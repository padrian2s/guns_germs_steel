                    <p>Core question: Why did Old World (Europe/Asia/Africa) develop guns, steel, horses, but Americas didn't? Why weren't Incas the ones inventing firearms, steel weapons, riding animals, bearing diseases to Europeans? Question shifts focus from Cajamarca collision narrative to underlying geographic causes determining technology divergence. Book's remaining task: explain why certain geographic regions developed certain technologies, enabling European conquest rather than American counter-conquest.</p>

                    <p>Core question: Why Eurasia-Africa developed technology, Americas didn't? Guns, steel, horses, diseases—all traceable to geographic differences. Why not Inca conquest of Europeans? Why Americas lacked Eurasian technologies? Question frames remaining book analysis: explaining geographic determinism mechanism. Geography determines technology distribution. Technology distribution determines conquest outcome. Reversing conquest (Americas→Europe) would require Americas possessing Eurasia's technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>Cajamarca 1532: Spanish conquered Inca through technology advantage (guns, steel, horses, disease). Opposite scenario never occurred: Inca never conquered Spanish. Historical contingency: Spanish happened to have advantageous technology. Thought experiment: reverse scenario requires Inca possessing guns, steel, horses, diseases. Inca lacked all four. Historical outcome determined by technology access not military capability or organizational sophistication. Technology difference geographic-determined, not random.</p>

                    <h3>Conexiune cu Teza Principală</h3>
                    <p>Book's remaining chapters answer: Why geographic differences created technology differences? Domesticable animals geography determines horses available. Metallurgy raw materials geography determines steel/guns. Domesticated animals geography determines disease pools. Continental axis geography determines technology diffusion speed. Geography→animals→metallurgy→disease→conquest. Eurasian geography created technology advantages. Americas geography created technology disadvantages. Conquest outcome geographically determined through technology difference cascade. Geographic determinism explains Cajamarca outcome through technology mechanism.</p>
