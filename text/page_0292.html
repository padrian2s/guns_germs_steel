                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>High population density regions (states and chiefdoms): defeated populations lack escape options. Victors exploit survivors two ways: slavery (chiefdoms/states with economic specialization) or tributary extraction (societies with intensive food production yielding large surpluses). Low-population-density regions: defeated bands flee to unclaimed lands, escape victors entirely. Population density determines exploitation feasibility. Dense populations forced integration into victor society; sparse populations escape through flight. Geography determining population density determines exploitation possibilities.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Population density determines conflict consequences. Sparse populations enable escape—defeated flee to unoccupied lands. Dense populations prevent escape—defeated must accept integration. Slavery viable when economic specialization creates demand for labor. Tribute extraction viable when agricultural surplus sufficient to support taxation. Geography determining population density determines whether conquered populations enslaved, tributary, or escaped. Institutional slavery/tribute systems geography-enabled through population density and agricultural infrastructure.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Desert regions Australia: low density enabled defeated band escape to unoccupied lands. Fertile Crescent/Nile Egypt: high density, intensive agriculture prevented escape, enabled slavery systems. Mesoamerica: high-density Aztec empire maintained slave systems. Steppe regions: nomadic populations enabled escape despite conflicts. Temperate agricultural regions: high density enabled both slavery and tribute systems. Contrasts show consistent pattern: agriculture-enabled dense populations trapped defeated populations; sparse-population regions enabled escape.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Slavery/tribute systems geography-determined by population density. Geography → agricultural capacity → population density → escape possibility. High-density regions → slavery/tribute emergence. Low-density regions → defeat enables escape. Geographic agricultural potential determines population density determines whether defeated populations enslaved or escaped. Slavery institution emerges necessarily from geography-imposed population density, not from evil intentions or cultural differences. Geography determining agricultural capacity determining population density determining institutional slavery systems available.</p>
