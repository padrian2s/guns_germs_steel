                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Bantu farmers from West African savanna expanded into wetter coastal forests by 3000 BCE. Archaeological/linguistic evidence shows: cattle, yams (wet-climate crops), no metals, fishing-hunting-gathering coexistence. Tsetse fly disease eliminated cattle in rainforests. Bantu technology adapted wet-forest zones, continuing expansion into Congo Basin. Environment shaped expansion technology adaptation.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Expansion technology must adapt geographic environment. Bantu savanna agriculture required modification wet-forest zones. Disease geography-constrained: tsetse flies limit cattle to certain zones. Crop adaptation geography-specific: yams suited wet zones better savanna crops. Expansion speed determined by geographic suitability. Environment barriers slow expansion reshape technology reshape cultural practice.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Bantu homeland savanna: cattle herding economy supplemented crops. Forest expansion (3000 BCE): rainforest environment unsuitable cattle (tsetse flies). Bantu response: loss of cattle maintaining crops (yams, manioc, plantains). Fishing/hunting/gathering supplemented agriculture. Continued expansion into Congo Basin maintained agriculture through wet-climate crops. Resource availability determined Bantu diet composition and economy structure.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic environment determines sustainable subsistence. Bantu technology (agriculture/animal herding) optimal savannas unsuitable rainforests. Geographic adaptation required for continued expansion. Tsetse fly distribution geography-constrained cattle presence. Climate geography determines crop suitability determines subsistence composition. Bantu expansion successful through technology flexibility adapting to geographic constraints. Geographic environment resistance—forests, disease, unsuitable crops—slowed expansion but technology adaptation enabled continuation. Population expansion limits geography-determined through disease and crop suitability.</p>
