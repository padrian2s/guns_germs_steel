                    <p>Western civilization taught origin Near East, developed Greece/Rome brilliance, produced three world religions (Christianity, Judaism, Islam). Eurocentrism assumes Western superiority. However, "Western" religions originated among Semitic-language-speaking peoples of Near East/North Africa—not European origin. Religion birth locations geography-determined by ancient Near East agricultural advantages enabling civilization emergence.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Geography determines civilization emergence geography determines religion emergence. Near East geography (Fertile Crescent domestication) enabled civilization development enabled religion development. Religious development requires civilization (writing, urban centers, organizational complexity). Geography enables civilization enables religion. Eurocentric mythology obscures geographic origin—religions arise where geography permits civilization.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Near East (Fertile Crescent) ~9000 years ago: first agriculture enabling cities enabling states enabling civilization. Judaism ~3500 years ago (Levantine Near East civilization). Christianity arose Near East within Roman empire extent. Islam arose Arabian peninsula within civilized context. Mediterranean trade enabled religion spread to Europe—Christianity/Islam became European after Near Eastern origin. Greece/Rome received innovations from earlier Near East sources (writing, mathematics, technology). European development depended on earlier Near Eastern/Mediterranean geography advantages enabling innovations.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geography determines civilization emergence determines religion emergence. Near East geographic advantages (domesticates, climate) enabled first civilizations enabled religious development. Religions emerged where geography permitted—Near East, not random locations. Europe received religions/technologies from geographically-advantaged regions. Eurocentrism misattributes origins assuming European primacy—geographic facts show Near East origin requiring geography advantages. Western civilization geography-rooted in Near Eastern advantages enabling civilization enabling religion. European prominence reflects geography-enabled reception/development of already-founded traditions, not independent origination.</p>
