                    <h3>Rezumat</h3>
                    <p>Fayu bands' conflict resolution mechanisms reflect egalitarian justice systems. When victim's relatives encountered killer (e.g., son recognizing father's murderer), physical confrontation occurred but was controlled through community restraint. Both combatants wrestled down by friends, held until exhausted enough to release. Other men shouted insults, shook weapons. Dispute resolution occurred without formal courts, police, judges. Small-scale society justice mechanisms differ from state-level institutions but serve equivalent social function.</p>

                    <h3>Concepte Cheie</h3>
                    <p>Band-scale justice depends on community enforcement, not formal institutions. Kinship networks determine justice participation (victim's relatives). Physical confrontation controlled through peer restraint. Small populations enable face-to-face conflict resolution—all community members know perpetrators. Formal justice institutions (courts, police) unnecessary when communities small enough for direct accountability. Justice mechanism type geography-determined through population scale.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>Fayu bands: 50-100 people, all interdependent, direct knowledge of transgressions. Conflict resolution: physical confrontation under community control—injuries risked but death-fighting prevented. Egalitarian justice: community responsibility for restraint, no formal enforcement roles. Contrast: state-level societies (1000+ people) - strangers unaccountable to direct community, require formal police/courts. European medieval villages: similar community-level justice (town square punishments, peer witnessing). State institutions emerged with population growth preventing direct accountability mechanisms.</p>

                    <p>Population scale geography-determined justice mechanisms. Small populations enable egalitarian justice through kinship and community direct enforcement. Large populations require formal institutions—strangers cannot maintain face-to-face accountability. Geography determines population density determines justice system type. Band societies' peer enforcement reflects optimal justice mechanism for small-scale geography. State societies' formal justice reflects inevitable institutional need with geography-driven population density growth.</p>
