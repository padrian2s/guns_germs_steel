                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Atahuallpa dismisses Bible offered by Spanish friar, showing contempt for written word unfamiliar to Inca. Inability to handle book demonstrates writing/literacy gap—technology unique to Old World (and Mesoamerica). Inca illiteracy contrasted with Spanish written culture. Atahuallpa's rejection signals disdain for unknown technology, foreshadowing miscalculation. First encounter shows cultural/technological differences explicitly: literacy as literacy advantage.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Literacy technology gap demonstrated explicitly. Inca empire lack writing: Atahuallpa unable to open book. Writing unique to Eurasian civilizations (except Mesoamerica). Inca quipu (knotted cord records) sophisticated but not writing. Inca elite unfamiliar with book technology. Writing-literacy gap foreshadows information technology advantage. Literacy enabling military coordination, record-keeping, organizational complexity. Writing geography-constrained: developed only certain regions.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Spanish friar offered Bible to Atahuallpa at Cajamarca. Atahuallpa unfamiliar with book: unable to open, threw it away after looking. Atahuallpa anger at unfamiliar technology (book/writing). Spanish literacy contrast highlighted. Inca quipu records sophisticated but not alphabetic writing. Writing technology developed only Eurasia (Egypt, Mesopotamia, China). Americas developed writing only Mesoamerica (Mayan, Aztec). Inca uniquely lacked writing despite empire sophistication.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Writing technology gap demonstrates geographic determinism. Writing emergence traced to agricultural civilization surplus. Inca agriculture-enabled empire but never developed writing independently. Writing invented separately only few regions: Fertile Crescent, Egypt, China, Mesoamerica. Inca missed independent writing invention. Geographic plant/animal availability determined civilization emergence but not writing. Inca received agriculture-technology but not writing-technology. Technology geography-determined through diffusion patterns and regional invention centers. Atahuallpa's unfamiliarity with book documents technology gap consequences.</p>
