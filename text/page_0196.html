                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Medical case introduces disease ecology as geographic determinant. Pneumonia patient with language barrier: imported disease demonstrates cross-cultural disease transfer. Microbes from animals represent geographic wildlife available. Disease selection pressure from geography-determined domestication patterns. Medical crisis exemplifies how microbes connect geography to human health outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Disease as geographic consequence of domestication. Zoonotic diseases: geography determines fauna available. Domestication of Eurasian animals cascaded into disease evolution. Population density determines disease types. Geographic availability of domesticable animals determines disease exposure patterns. Cross-cultural disease introduction: geography determines initial disease resistance levels.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Old World domesticated animals sourced diseases: cattle plague, measles, smallpox. Americas domestic animals limited: only dogs available (no large mammals). Disease ecology Old World vs Americas determined by fauna geography. Pneumonia patient illustrates disease crossing: Old World disease meets New World population lacking acquired immunity. Immigration example shows geographic disease immunity patterns.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geography determines domesticable fauna. Fauna geography determines zoonotic disease availability. Disease availability determines population immunity levels. Population immunity determines disease resistance when populations meet. Technology conquest depends on disease advantage. Geographic fauna determines which populations retain disease-evolved immunity advantages in conflict. Geography cascades to disease epidemiology cascades to conquest outcomes.</p>
