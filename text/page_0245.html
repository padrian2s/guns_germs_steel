                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Steam engine development exemplifies technology as incremental diffusion, not singular invention. Savery → Newcomen → Watt → subsequent improvements. Watt credited as "inventor" but built on Newcomen's design, added separate condenser and double-acting cylinder. All "hero inventors" actually refined previous designs. Documentation shows pattern: credited inventor follows predecessors with similar aims and existing designs.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Invention as cumulative improvement. Technology advancement occurs through step-by-step refinement, not individual genius. Hero myth of invention obscures reality: designers build on predecessors' solutions. Technological progress requires both initial innovation and supportive conditions enabling incremental improvement. Geographic infrastructure (metallurgical skills, manufacturing capacity, economic incentives) determines whether innovations can be implemented and refined.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Steam engine: Savery (1698) pumping device → Newcomen (1712) atmospheric engine → Watt (1764) condenser improvement. England's coal geography created mining pumping problem—geographic incentive driving innovation. Metallurgical advances enabling better casting and cylinder manufacture came from iron/metal-working infrastructure geography. Industrial Revolution occurred in England/Scotland due to geographic coal access and industrial capacity concentration, enabling steam engine refinement and application.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Technology innovation geography-driven through economic incentives and manufacturing capacity. Coal-rich England developed mining technology need. Metal-working infrastructure capacity geographic-determined by mineral deposits. Steam engine improvements required supportive manufacturing geography. Geographic resource availability (coal, iron, skilled workers) determined innovation location and refinement rate. Technology advancement follows geography-created incentives and constraints.</p>
