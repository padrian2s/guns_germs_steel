                    <p>Spanish attack: gunfire and horse charges panic Inca warriors unfamiliar with these technologies. Inca attempt to escape by breaking plaza wall. Spanish cavalry pursues, targeting "those with fancy clothes" (Inca leaders). Panic-driven rout demonstrates technology novelty effect: guns and horses psychologically terrified Inca troops. Combination of unknown weapons and mounted soldiers created overwhelming advantage despite heavy numerical disadvantage.</p>

                    <h3>Concepte Cheie</h3>
                    <p>Psychological shock from unfamiliar technology determines initial outcome. Guns/horses unprecedented in Americas: Inca warriors unable to respond effectively. Technology novelty creates panic: Inca not culturally prepared for firearms/cavalry. Panic-driven rout demonstrates that technology advantage operates through both physical effectiveness and psychological disruption. Spanish firearms/horses created double advantage: physical superiority plus terrifying unfamiliarity.</p>

                    <p>Cajamarca plaza attack: Spanish guns and cavalry charge against Inca warriors unfamiliar with gunpowder weapons or mounted combat. Inca panic response documented in accounts. Warriors attempted escape by breaking plaza wall. Spanish cavalry pursuits targeted Inca leaders. Psychological terror from unknown weapons contributed significantly to Spanish victory. Inca soldiers fled despite numbers.</p>

                    <h3>Conexiune cu Teza Principală</h3>
                    <p>Technology advantage operates through two pathways: physical capability and psychological shock. Spanish guns/horses provided geographic technology advantage. Inca lack of domesticated horses meant no cavalry warfare experience. Gunpowder weapons originated Eurasian geography. Americas horses extinct since Ice Age: geography prevented Inca cavalry or cavalry combat experience. Technology unfamiliarity amplified physical advantage. Geographic technology distribution determined both material and psychological conquest advantage.</p>
