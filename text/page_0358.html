                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>American civilizations never connected by fast/high-volume trade networks like Eurasia (Asia-Europe plague/influenza/smallpox routes). Eurasian disease epidemics (plague, influenza, possibly smallpox) killed populations but created immunity selection. Americas lacked equivalent disease trade circuits. Malaria and yellow fever (tropical disease obstacles to European colonization and Panama Canal construction) not American but Old World African diseases. Disease ecology geography-determined through trade network patterns determining exposure patterns determining population immunity determining disease impact.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Disease ecology trade-network-dependent. Eurasian trade concentration created disease circulation creating population immunity. Americas isolated trade networks prevented disease circulation preventing immunity development. Old World tropical diseases (malaria, yellow fever) African geographic origin. Americas lacked equivalent tropical disease environment creating immunity. Disease exposure geography-determined through continent isolation determining immunity patterns determining disease vulnerability.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Eurasia extensive trade: plague from Asia devastated 1300s Europe killing 30-50% populations. Survivor immunity genetic selection created resistant populations. Influenza regular circulation through trade networks. Americas three empires (Aztec, Inca, others) never interconnected by intensive trade like Eurasian. Trade isolation prevented disease circulation prevented population immunity development. African tropical diseases (malaria, yellow fever) unknown Americas pre-1492. European colonizers inadvertently imported unfamiliar disease ecosystems to Americas lacking indigenous immunity.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Disease ecology geography-determined through continental trade patterns and climate. Eurasian connectivity created disease circulation creating population adaptation. Americas geographic isolation prevented disease circulation prevented immunity. Old World tropical diseases geographic climate distribution. Americas tropical zones lacked equivalent disease ecology creating population vulnerability. Epidemic disease impact colonization determined by disease exposure history geography-contingent. European disease advantage reflected geographic disease ecology differences, not biological differences.</p>
