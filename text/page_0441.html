                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Bibliography sources on disease epidemiology and ancient disease: Bartlett measles epidemic analysis calculates minimum population size required maintain measles endemicity. Dobson parasite behavior describes how parasites enhance transmission modifying host behavior. Cockburn mummies/diseases study identifies ancient diseases through mummy analysis. Sources document disease ecology and transmission dynamics. Measles minimum population size (500,000-1 million) explains epidemic disease geographic distribution—large population centers required maintain infections. Parasite transmission enhancement through behavior modification shows disease evolution geography-dependent: geographic isolation prevents epidemic disease maintenance, larger populations sustain epidemic disease cycles.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Measles epidemic thresholds: diseases require minimum population size maintaining transmission chains. Small populations (<1 million) cannot maintain measles continuously—infection dies out. Large populations support endemic disease cycles. Measles herd immunity: populations accumulating immunity through infection/vaccination reducing transmission. Geographic isolation prevents disease maintenance: isolated populations too small epidemic diseases cannot persist. Pathogen transmission geography: diseases evolve specific animal/human transmission vectors. Parasite behavior modification: pathogens alter host behavior enhancing own transmission. Disease ecology demonstrates geographic population size determines disease persistence—geographic barriers creating small population isolates prevent epidemic disease maintenance.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Measles historical emergence: pestis minor (Hippocratic period) or eruptive disease predecessor, distinct modern measles documented ~1000 AD. Measles minimum population size 500,000 suggests measles emerged when large populations established medieval cities provided sufficient populations maintaining endemic measles. Pre-measles era: isolated populations lacked disease pressure. Pathogen jumps from animal sources: measles probably derived cattle rinderpest or similar animal plague. Ancient diseases documented mummy analysis showing tuberculosis, parasites afflicting ancient Egypt. Geographic variation: isolated populations lacking domestication lacked epidemic diseases from animals. Old World domestication generated disease burden conferring immunity to populations with agriculture/cities.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Disease ecology geography-determined through population geography: domestication enables agriculture enables cities enables epidemic disease maintenance. Measles minimum population size proves geographic civilization difference produces disease burden difference. Old World large populations generated epidemic disease maintenance conferring immunity. Americas isolated populations lacked epidemic disease pressure—insufficient population size maintaining endemic disease. Geographic isolation prevented epidemic disease development—not microbe absence but population size geography preventing disease establishment. Epidemic disease became Old World advantage conferring population immunity. Disease burden geography-determined through domestication producing large populations producing epidemic disease pressure producing immunity—geographic determinism operating microbial level. Geography determines population size determines disease ecology determines population immunity determining resistance advantage.</p>
