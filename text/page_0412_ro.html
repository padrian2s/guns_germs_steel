                    <p>China technology dominance: cast iron, compass, gunpowder, paper, printing, many others (detailed earlier chapters). Political power, navigation, sea control leadership 15th century. Treasure fleets: hundreds of ships, 400 feet length, 28,000 crew members, reached Indian Ocean + East Africa coast. Decades before Columbus's three ships crossed Atlantic. Question: Why did China lose technological preeminence to late-starting Europe? Technology advantage not maintained despite early dominance.</p>

                    <p>Technology advantage temporary if political decisions end development. Initial technology lead requires sustained investment maintaining advantage. China maritime dominance abandoned 1433: deliberate political decision stopped fleet expeditions. Europe fragmentation created competitive pressure sustained exploration. Single power can choose maritime investment or abandonment; fragmented powers compete forcing continuation.</p>

                    <p>China treasure fleets 1405-1433: Zheng He commanded massive naval expeditions. Indian Ocean exploration reached Africa establishing Ming dominance. 1433: Chinese leadership withdrew—political decision prioritizing land security (Mongol threats) over maritime exploration. Europe 15th century fragmented: Portugal continued exploration (motivated by Islamic containment seeking Asia). Spain competitive pressure from Portuguese initiated Columbus sponsorship. Portuguese/Spanish continuous maritime competition 1400s-1600s driving exploration technology innovation. Chinese decision abandoned maritime advantage; European competition forced continuation.</p>

                    <p>Geography determines maritime capacity (ships, knowledge) but political geography determines maritime investment. China geography enabled maritime preeminence (technology, resources, manufacturing). Europe geography fragmentation created competition forcing maritime continuation. Single unified power (China) abandoned maritime advantage through political decision. Fragmented powers (Europe) compelled maritime investment through competitive pressure. Coastline geography determines maritime possibility; political geography determines maritime investment necessity. Europe's geographic political fragmentation created competitive selection pressure forcing continued technology development. China's political unification enabled decision abandoning development advantage.</p>
