                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>History not traditionally conceived as science. Historians don't label departments "Historical Science." Few historians receive scientific methodology training. History perceived as detail-mass without pattern: "one damn fact after another," "history is bunk," "kaleidoscope law." Historical science legitimacy questioned traditionally. Guns, Germs, Steel implicitly claims history can become science through geographic patterns and mechanisms.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>History legitimacy as science requires identifying patterns and mechanisms. Historians traditionally resisted scientific framing. Historical science requires systematic methodology beyond narrative. Geographic determinism enables historical pattern recognition. Mechanisms (domestication→agriculture→civilization) enable causal explanation enable science. Historical science possible if underlying patterns exist.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Traditional history humanities discipline. Scientific departments (physics, chemistry, biology) viewed rigorous. History perceived storytelling lacking law-like generalizations. Some historians resist quantification/mechanism emphasis. Others (historical science advocates) argue patterns and causes discoverable. This book advocates history science position: geography patterns and mechanisms enable explanation and prediction.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic determinism enables history science by identifying universal mechanisms (domestication patterns, diffusion barriers, disease ecology). These mechanisms enable pattern recognition enable prediction enable science. History need not remain descriptive narrative—underlying geographic causes make patterns analyzable scientifically. If geographic mechanisms operate universally, history becomes testable science rather than contingent narrative.</p>
