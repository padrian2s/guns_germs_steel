                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Diamond notes that proximate explanations (guns, germs, steel) clearly explain European conquests—but remain incomplete. The crucial gap asks why Europeans possessed these factors. He cites Africa as a puzzle: despite the longest human evolutionary history and tropical diseases that killed Europeans, Africa never developed guns and steel first. Arnold Toynbee's comparative history attempted such questions but focused narrowly on literate Eurasian civilizations, missing prehistory where inequality roots lie.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Diamond identifies the intellectual gap: proximate explanations describe immediate mechanisms of conquest without explaining their ultimate origins. Toynbee's approach examined advanced civilizations but ignored pre-literate history and non-Eurasian societies. A comprehensive theory requires examining all human societies and all human history, not just literate civilizations of the last 5,000 years.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Toynbee's 12-volume "Study of History" (1934-1961) represented the last major Western attempt at comprehensive historical synthesis before specialists fragmented into disciplinary silos. By the 1990s, historians had largely abandoned such ambitious meta-historical questions, leaving Yali's question unanswered.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Diamond positions his work as ambitious synthesis that previous historians abandoned. He promises to bridge the intellectual and moral gap by explaining ultimate causes rooted in geography and prehistory. The book must accomplish what Toynbee attempted but failed: a genuine theory of history's broadest pattern.</p>
