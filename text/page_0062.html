                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Political unit size determined by island area and terrain fragmentation. Small isolated islands formed single political units. Large rugged islands divided into many independent units. Island proximity determined if neighboring islands unified. Political fragmentation affected development capacity: small units cannot support large construction projects or armies. Geography directly determines political organization scale.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Political unit size geography-determined by island size and terrain fragmentation. Terrain communication barriers create fragmentation: large rugged islands → multiple political units. Island isolation enables unification: nearby small islands → single political unit. Political fragmentation affects capacity: small units cannot execute large projects or field large armies. Geography → political scale → military/construction capacity.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Small isolated islands: single political unit (unified authority). Large rugged islands: many independent political units (geographic fragmentation prevents unification). Geographic proximity: multiple small islands coalesce (common politics). Political unit size directly reflects island geography: size and internal terrain. Hawaii: large islands enabled empire-scale political unit. Polynesian islands: fragmented terrain created political multiplicity.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Political organization geography-determined through island size and terrain. Terrain fragmentation creates political fragmentation: geography enforces political multiplicity on large rugged islands. Island isolation prevents unification: geography enforces political separation. Political scale geography-limited: small islands cannot support large political units requiring extensive population/resources. Geography determines feasible political organization through population size and terrain communication barriers.</p>
