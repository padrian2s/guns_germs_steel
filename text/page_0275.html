                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Chiefdoms characteristics: hierarchically ranked lineages concentrating marriages within lineage. Require menial servants and specialized craftspeople—jobs filled by slaves obtained through capture in raids. Shift from reciprocal exchange (bands/tribes) to redistribution economic system. Chiefs accumulate resources and redistribute in patron-client relationships. Chiefdoms represent political innovation enabling population coordination beyond tribal kinship limits.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Chiefdom emergence requires surplus production and population density. Ranking and slavery presume population pressure enabling raid captives. Specialized occupations require supporting surplus population. Redistribution system more efficient than reciprocal exchange at larger population scales. Political hierarchy emerges as solution to coordinating large populations. Chiefdoms feasible only where geography permits sufficient population density.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Chiefdoms developed where geographic conditions permitted high population density: Pacific islands with good agricultural bases (Hawai'i, Samoa), river valley civilizations, temperate regions with surplus-enabling crops. Require capture-based slavery implying population pressure and warfare. Ranking systems emerge where coordination benefits exceed egalitarian efficiencies. Slaves and specialists sustainable only with agricultural surplus—geography determines surplus possibility. Regional variation in chiefdom complexity reflects geographic agricultural productivity variation.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Political complexity reflects geographic carrying capacity and surplus-enabling conditions. Chiefdoms impossible without agricultural surplus—geography determines agriculture possibility. Population density geography-determined by resource availability creates conditions enabling political stratification. Ranking systems emerge as population coordination solution. Slavery sustainable only with surplus populations—geography determines surplus. Political hierarchy directly follows from geographic agricultural potential enabling population growth.</p>
