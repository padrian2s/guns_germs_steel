                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Diamond presents the prologue's central question asked by Yali, a New Guinean politician: why do Europeans possess more cargo (technology, wealth, goods) than New Guineans? This seemingly simple question masks a profound puzzle about global inequality that historians have largely abandoned.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>The core question concerns why disparities in wealth and power exist between populations. Diamond reformulates this into broader historical inquiry: why didn't Native Americans, Africans, and Aboriginal Australians dominate Europeans instead? By 1500 CE, technological differences were already pronounced—some continents had metal-equipped empires while others possessed stone or iron tools.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Diamond's personal encounter with Yali in 1972 New Guinea prompted this investigation. By the book's writing (1997), a century of colonial expansion had already reshaped global power dynamics. Diamond's timing challenges historical amnesia about why certain continents achieved technological superiority by the 15th-16th centuries.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Yali's question becomes the framework for Diamond's geographical determinism thesis. Rather than invoking racial or cultural superiority, Diamond argues that by 1500 CE, continental differences in technology and political organization were already established—differences rooted in geography, not biology. This sets up his investigation into why geography channeled different resources to different continents.</p>
