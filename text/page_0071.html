                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Eyewitness account: Inca procession approaching Cajamarca featured 2,000 sweepers preceding Atahuallpa, warriors arranged on both sides. Elaborate ceremonial display with warriors dressed in distinctive colored garments. Massive Inca force demonstrated military organization and grandeur. Spanish witnesses terrified of numbers despite complete technological advantage. Narrative emphasizes Inca organization contrasted with Spanish numerical inferiority (168 vs 80,000+).</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Military organization scales with population and state capacity. Inca force demonstrated 80,000+ warriors with organizational hierarchy. 2,000 sweepers and formal procession showed administrative capacity. Spanish terrified but maintained discipline despite numbers. Organization and equipment, not numbers, determined outcome. Technology (horses, guns, steel armor) more decisive than personnel quantities. Small discipline-organized force with technology advantage defeated larger undisciplined force.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Inca procession approaching Cajamarca: 2,000 sweepers clearing road, warriors arranged in columns, colored dress uniforms showing organization. Spanish witnesses awed by numbers (80,000+ warriors) and Inca military organization. Spanish 168 men vs. Inca multitudes. Spanish fear evident despite perception of Inca power. Eyewitness testimony documents numerical disparity: Inca organization sophisticated but technology-weak.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Inca military organization impressive but technology-limited. Large force organization sophisticated (processions, hierarchy, discipline) but lacks horses/guns/steel. Spanish small force possessed technology advantages. Eyewitness terror reflects numbers but not outcome: technology determined result despite Spanish fear. Geography-determined technology advantages overcome Inca organizational sophistication. Conquest outcome not determined by organization capacity but by technology gap geography created.</p>
