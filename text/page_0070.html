                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Spanish soldiers' eyewitness account entering Cajamarca: Pizarro with 168 men confronting 80,000 Inca warriors. Spanish fear evident despite numerical advantage. Elaborate Inca camp visible. Spanish ambushed Inca force in plaza, capturing and executing Atahualpa. Account emphasizes Spanish military trepidation despite small numbers—contrasts Spanish technological edge (guns, horses, steel) against overwhelming Inca numerical superiority.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Military asymmetry: 168 Spanish vs 80,000+ Incas. Spanish advantages: horses, guns, steel weapons, armor, organization. Inca lack: horses, firearms, organized response to Spanish tactics. Psychological novelty of Spanish weapons: initial Inca paralysis from unfamiliarity with horses/guns.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>1532 Cajamarca collision. Inca Empire at height: organized military, large armies. Spanish conquistadors: small, outnumbered expedition. Pizarro's tactics: deception, surprise, cavalry charges. Atahualpa captured/executed, triggering Inca political collapse.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Technology determined outcome despite numerical disadvantage. Geographic factors (Old World horses, metallurgy, firearms) gave Spanish military superiority. Americas lacked these technologies due to geographic isolation, different fauna, independent technology development. Technology gap resulted from geographic difference in domesticable species.</p>
