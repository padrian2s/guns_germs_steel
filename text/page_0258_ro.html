                    <h3>Rezumat</h3>
                    <p>Japan's samurai government restricted guns despite gunpowder availability—not due to cultural rejection but political incentive. Government restricted gun production to few cities, required licenses (issued only for government use), reduced government orders until Japan lacked functional guns. Even despised technologies can be suppressed if ruling class perceives threat to power. European rulers also despised guns but economic pressure forced adoption. Technology adoption depends on power structures and economic incentives, not cultural attitudes alone.</p>

                    <h3>Concepte Cheie</h3>
                    <p>Technology adoption determined by power structure incentives, not cultural preferences. Samurai perceived guns threatened their military monopoly—restricted adoption. European feudal lords initially opposed guns but peasant armies with guns eventually forced adoption for competition. Economic incentive (competitive disadvantage without guns) overrides ruling class preference. Stable isolated societies (Japan) can suppress technologies if power structures unified. Open competitive environments (fragmented Europe) force technology adoption despite initial resistance. Geographic and political context determines technology adoption pressure.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>Japan 1600 CE: unified government under samurai control, island isolation enabled suppression policy. Gun production restricted, licenses controlled, government orders eliminated. Samurai interest in maintaining traditional military dominance enforced gun rejection for ~250 years. Europe 1450-1700 CE: fragmented into competing monarchies. Rulers initially opposed guns threatening knight military structure. Competitive warfare forced adoption—kingdoms refusing guns faced conquest. Geographic fragmentation (many competing states) created competitive pressure overriding individual rulers' preferences. Island isolation enabled Japan to escape this competitive pressure.</p>

                    <h3>Conexiune cu Teza Principală</h3>
                    <p>Geographic isolation enables societies to resist technologies through political suppression. Japan's island geography enabled samurai-controlled unified government enforcing gun restriction. Continent geography fragmentation creates competitive pressure forcing technology adoption despite resistance. Geographic fragmentation determined Europe's technology adoption path—required competitive arms races. Geographic unity (island isolation, unified government) enabled Japan's alternative path rejecting guns. Geography determines political conditions (unified vs. fragmented) which determine adoption pressure. Same technology adopted or rejected based on geographic-political circumstances.</p>
