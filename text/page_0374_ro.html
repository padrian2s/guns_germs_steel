                    <p>Conquest accomplished largely by germs alone, introduced ahead of Spanish military. Mandans, Sadlermiut Eskimos, and countless native societies wiped out by disease without military action. Populous native societies survived germs then destroyed by full-scale warfare. Disease ecology geography-determined—European disease burden eliminated unprepared populations.</p>

                    <p>Disease ecology geography-determined through continental disease exposure history. Eurasian domesticated animals created epidemic diseases (smallpox, measles, flu). Americas isolated no equivalent diseases. European populations exposed centuries developing immunity. American populations unexposed no immunity. Disease impact geography-determined: Eurasian trade creating disease circulation creating immunity. Americas isolation preventing disease circulation preventing immunity development. Geography determines disease immunity determines conquest ease.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>Mandans (Missouri River): pre-contact population ~15,000, 1837 smallpox epidemic killed ~11,000. Sadlermiut Eskimos (Arctic): isolated population wiped out tuberculosis (European disease). Countless other societies: Arawaks, Lucayan, Taino, Pueblo peoples decimated disease before combat. Aztec conquest 1519-1521: Cortez 600 men conquered 100,000+ Aztec, but disease killed more than Spanish killed—plague spread to Mexican interior. Inca conquest similar pattern—civil war weakened by disease, Spanish small force conquered empire. American disease-naive populations: no whooping cough immunity, no influenza immunity, no measles immunity—childhood diseases killed adults without immunity.</p>

                    <p>Conquest outcome determined by disease, disease ecology geography-determined. European disease advantages reflected Eurasian geographic advantages (domesticated animals creating epidemics). American disease vulnerability reflected geographic isolation (no epidemic disease exposure). Conquest ease geography-determined: populations decimated disease required minimal military force. Population replacement geography-determined: disease elimination created settlement vacuums enabled European settlement. Conquest outcome reflects disease geography not military capability. American defeat reflected geographic isolation creating disease vulnerability—geography determined conquest outcome.</p>
