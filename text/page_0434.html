                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Bibliography sources: Easter Island Earth Island (Bahn/Flenley 1992) documents geographic isolation societal collapse. Easter Island geographic case-study: isolated Pacific island developing complex civilization then collapsing through resource depletion. Pizarro conquest sources (Hernando/Pedro Pizarro, Estete, Mena, Xerez eyewitness accounts) document Spanish conquest of Atahuallpa and Inca empire. Two contrasting geographic outcomes: Easter Island geographic isolation limiting civilization sustainability—resources depleted, population collapsed. Pizarro conquest showing geographic advantages (disease, horses, steel) enabling Spanish conquest of larger American civilization. Both cases demonstrate geography determining civilization sustainability (island resources) and technological advantage (Old World disease/animals).</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Easter Island: Polynesian settlement ~800 AD, complex society developed (monumental architecture moai statues, social hierarchy). Deforestation and resource depletion ~1500 AD collapsed civilization—population crash, social collapse, statue carving ceased. Geographic constraint: isolated island with limited resources. Resource depletion inevitable when population growth exceeded sustainable carrying capacity. No external trade rescued island (isolated geography prevented contact). Pizarro conquest (1532): Atahuallpa captured with 177 Spanish soldiers defeating thousands of Inca. Spanish advantages: horses (unknown Americas), steel weapons superior to bronze, firearms (gunpowder—Old World technology), epidemic diseases (smallpox already decimating Inca empire before conquest). Technology and disease advantages derived from Old World geography providing domesticated animals and epidemic history.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Easter Island geography: isolated Pacific island, limited fauna (no mammals for domestication), limited flora (eventual deforestation). Complex civilization emerged 800-1500 AD showing human capability civilization development anywhere. Population growth unsustainable—island resources finite. Deforestation and rat predation depleted bird populations and palm forests. Population overshot carrying capacity. Collapse predictable from geography: island isolation meant no external rescue, no alternative resources, no refuge populations. Pizarro conquest (1532): Spanish arrived with technological advantages geography determined. Horses introduced ~1500s Americas—unknown previously (megafauna extinct). Steel metallurgy Old World technology. Gunpowder technology Old World innovation. Smallpox killed estimated 95% Inca population before Spanish conquest battles—disease created vulnerability to conquest. Inca had no domestic horses, no steel, no gunpowder, no epidemic disease immunity—all Old World geography advantages.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Easter Island proves geographic determinism through resource constraint limit: isolated geography determines civilization sustainability. Complex civilization possible (humans capable), but geographic isolation dooms civilization when resources depleted. Geography-isolated societies vulnerable collapse. Pizarro conquest proves technology advantage geography-derived: Spanish advantages (horses, steel, gunpowder, disease immunity) accumulated through Old World geography providing domestication sources and epidemic disease pressure through millennial urbanization. Conquest successful because technology advantage geography-derived, not human superiority. Two cases demonstrate geography determining civilization outcomes: Easter Island showing geography resource constraints limit sustainability, Pizarro showing geography technology advantages determine conquest outcomes. Both prove geography determines civilization fate through resource limits and technology distribution geography produces.</p>
