                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Four sets of geographic factors quantifiable and objectively measurable: domestication materials (mammal herbivores, cereals), environmental suitability, diffusion/migration rates, area + competing societies. Eurasia: largest landmass, most competing societies (enables competition driving innovation). Americas: large aggregate area but geographically/ecologically fragmented (functions as multiple smaller continents). Australia/Tasmania: smallest areas, fewest competing societies (limits innovation pressure). Geographic factors scientifically quantifiable enabling testable predictions.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Geographic factors objective: continent size measurable, species available countable, competition intensity quantifiable. Scientific history: measurable variables predict outcomes. Large landmass enables competition drives innovation. Fragmented geography limits competition limits innovation. Area determines maximum population density determines maximum technology complexity. Competing societies drive technology advancement through competitive pressure.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Eurasia: 55 million km² (largest), Eurasian societies competing (Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, Persia, Greece, Rome), competition driving technological advancement. Americas: ~40 million km² aggregate but ecologically separated, Aztec/Inca/Mississippian independently developing without intensive interaction, limited competition innovation. Australia: ~7.7 million km², minimal societies, minimal competition, minimal innovation. Geographic competition intensity: Eurasia high, Americas moderate/fragmented, Australia low.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Historic science measurement: quantify geographic factors predict development outcomes. Large competing continents → rapid innovation through competitive pressure. Fragmented continents → slower innovation through reduced competition. Small isolated continents → minimal innovation through population/competition limits. Four factors (domesticates, suitability, diffusion, competition) explain development differences. Measurable geographic variables predict historical outcomes enabling history as rigorous science.</p>
