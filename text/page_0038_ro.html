                    <p>Early Homo sapiens (500,000+ years ago) differed substantially from modern humans in skeletal structure and brain size. Their stone tools were crude compared to modern peoples, and they lacked the cultural sophistication of later humans. Diamond emphasizes that the transition from Homo erectus to Homo sapiens was gradual, not a sudden behavioral revolution.</p>

                    <p>Distinction between anatomically modern humans and behaviorally modern humans. Early Homo sapiens possessed smaller brains and made unimpressive tools—modern stone-tool-making peoples would have scorned them. Geographic barriers (water crossings) remained impassable without later technological innovations.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>Early Homo sapiens occupied Africa and Europe from ~500,000 years ago. Despite anatomical modernity, behavioral and technological capabilities remained primitive. Australia and Americas remained unpeopled due to technological limitations in watercraft.</p>

                    <h3>Conexiune cu Teza Principală</h3>
                    <p>Geographic expansion potential was constrained by technological development. Not all humans with the same anatomy had equal capacity for geographic colonization—technology, not biology, determined which continents could be reached. This pattern establishes geography's controlling role in human development.</p>
