                    <p>Tribes: intermediate political organization between bands and chiefdoms. Maintain alliances with neighboring hamlets regardless of language differences (example: Fore-speakers and different language groups maintaining ties). Tribes occupy much of modern New Guinea, Melanesia, Amazonia. Archaeological evidence: substantial settlements in past lacked chiefdom archaeological hallmarks. Tribal organization inferred from settlement size without state-level institutions. Tribes represent larger organized groups than bands but without hereditary leadership.</p>

                    <h3>Concepte Cheie</h3>
                    <p>Tribe: population scale 100s-1000s enabling cooperation beyond kinship. Tribal alliances maintain peace across language/ethnic boundaries. Tribal organization requires larger resources than bands but less surplus than chiefdoms. Archaeological signatures: settlement size without central authority indicators (fortifications, elite burials, ceremonial centers). Geographic conditions permitting moderate population concentration without full agricultural transition. Tribe size reflects geographic carrying capacity larger than bands but unable to support state institutions.</p>

                    <h3>Context Istoric și Geografic</h3>
                    <p>New Guinea tribal system: 500-2000 people per tribe, multiple hamlet settlements maintaining alliances. Alliances prevent warfare through marriage partnerships, exchange relationships, ceremonial ties. Melanesian and Amazonian tribes similarly show inter-hamlet confederation maintaining larger political units than autonomous bands. Archaeological progression: small band settlements (pre-2000 BCE) → larger tribal villages (2000-500 BCE) → chiefdom centers with public architecture (500 BCE onward). Transition reflects population growth from geographic productivity increases.</p>

                    <h3>Conexiune cu Teza Principală</h3>
                    <p>Tribal emergence reflects geographic conditions enabling larger populations than band-scale but preventing state-scale organization. Geography enables population growth creating coordination need beyond kinship. Tribes represent adaptive political structure for this intermediate population scale. Different from bands through alliance systems coordinating multiple settlements. Different from chiefdoms through lack of centralized authority or ranking. Tribal organization directly reflects geography's population-carrying capacity permitting this intermediate scale.</p>
