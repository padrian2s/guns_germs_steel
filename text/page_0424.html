                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Little Ice Age contributed Greenland Norse extinction (1300-1500 AD) but unpredictable in advance—no historian/climatologist could have predicted Little Ice Age emergence. Climate change (contingency) cascaded societal collapse. Historians face similar difficulties establishing causation as astronomers, climatologists, ecologists, evolutionary biologists, geologists, paleontologists—observational sciences dealing with complex unpredictable systems.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Climate contingency: unpredictable changes (Little Ice Age) causing societal effects. Multiple causal chains complicate history explanation. Observable patterns (Greenland marginal climate) but unpredictable events (climate shifts) cascade outcomes. Historical causation difficult through contingency/complexity in observational disciplines.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Greenland: marginal climate sustainability. Climate shift (Little Ice Age) pushed beyond sustainability threshold. If Ice Age hadn't occurred, Norse might have persisted. But Ice Age was unforeseeable contingency. Same pattern: astronomy can explain stars forming but cannot predict specific star life-time, geology can explain plate tectonics but cannot predict specific earthquakes.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic determinism doesn't guarantee predictive power. Geography determines possibilities/constraints but contingencies operate within constraints. Observational sciences (including history) can identify patterns and mechanisms but cannot predict specific contingent events. Greenland Norse: geography constrained survival (marginal climate) but contingent ice age cascaded collapse. History follows patterns (geographic determination) but specific events (contingencies) unpredictable creating apparent chaos within determined framework.</p>
