                    <p>Between 100,000-50,000 years ago, a "Great Leap Forward" revolutionized human capability. Lascaux Cave paintings of bulls and horses demonstrate creators were mentally modern. This momentous change poses two unresolved questions: its triggering cause and geographic origin—did it occur in Africa, multiregionally, or elsewhere?</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Great Leap Forward: sudden behavioral modernity emergence. Art production, standardized tools, complex hunting. Unresolved cause: language evolution? Brain reorganization? Genetic mutation? Geographic origin debated—African origin vs multiregional development.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Great Leap Forward ~50,000 years ago correlates with Cro-Magnon emergence in Europe, replacing Neanderthals. Lascaux Cave art (~17,000 BCE) represents cognitive sophistication indicating mental modernity achieved well before.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic location of Great Leap Forward determined which regions first possessed modern behavioral capacity. Early geographic origin would provide head start for technological and civilization development. This initiates geographic divergence in human capability.</p>
