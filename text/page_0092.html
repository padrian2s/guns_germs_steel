                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Diseases emerged from domestic animals (smallpox, measles, flu from animal-derived pathogens). Animal-domesticating societies experienced disease first, then evolved resistance through natural selection. Americas lacked domesticated animals, so Americans never encountered these pathogens, had no evolved immunity. Conquest advantage tied to centuries of prior disease exposure.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Disease evolution and immunity. Eurasian domesticated animals → epidemic diseases → evolved immunity in Eurasian populations. Americas: no domesticated animals → no epidemic diseases → no immunity development. Pathogen exposure differentials created immunological advantage in conquest.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Smallpox, measles, influenza: major killers in Eurasian history by 1500 CE. Eurasian populations carried partial immunity. Americas 1492: no populations had measles, smallpox, or influenza immunity due to lack of domesticated animals. Pathogens killed 95% of American populations, Spanish faced previously healthy adult populations lacking immunity defenses.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic fauna distribution determines disease burden and immunity evolution. Eurasian domesticated animals provided disease pressure and immunity. Americas lacked domesticates, lacked disease pressure, lacked immunity. Accident of geography (fauna distribution) determined immunological capacity difference in 1492 contact. Conquest depended not on Spanish superiority but on pathogenic accident of history.</p>
