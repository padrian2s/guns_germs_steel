                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>By AD 1492, most of the world organized in chiefdoms, tribes, or bands—not states. State formation requires explanation. Rousseau's social contract theory: states formed by rational agreement—people calculated self-interest and chose state over egalitarianism. However, this theory implies voluntary adoption explaining why states formed. However, kleptocracy theory suggests states benefit elites not commoners—why would commoners voluntarily accept extraction? Geographic determinism offers alternative: geography enables certain populations to support states; those populations inevitably develop states through environmental pressure not rational choice.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Social contract theory: rational choice model assuming deliberate state adoption. Geographic determinism: state formation inevitable given geography enabling population density. Kleptocratic critique: populations wouldn't voluntarily accept exploitation. Geographic pressure model: sufficient population density creates organization pressure; states emerge necessarily not voluntarily. Regions unable to support state-scale populations remain tribal. Geography determines whether state formation possible, not whether populations choose states.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Fertile Crescent: geography permitted large populations → state formation inevitable. Australia: geography permitted small populations → remained tribal. Americas: variable geography → chiefdoms in some regions (Mesoamerica, Andes), tribes elsewhere. Oceania: island geographic variation → states in Polynesia, tribes in Melanesia. Consistent pattern: geography permitting large population density → states; geography limiting population → tribes. No evidence of rational populations voting to accept kleptocracy. State formation follows geographic pattern, not rational choice pattern.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic determinism superior to social contract theory explaining state formation. Geography determines whether populations reach densities where states necessary. Population pressure (geography-driven) creates state emergence necessity. Geographic differences explain state distribution: high-agriculture regions developed states; low-agriculture regions remained tribal. Kleptocratic elites didn't persuade populations; geography simply permitted only those settlements large enough to require hierarchical coordination. State formation geography-inevitable, not rationally chosen.</p>
