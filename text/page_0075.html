                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Native American tribes only reduced military disparity by acquiring European horses and guns. Plains Indians (Sioux), Araucanian (Chile), Pampas (Argentina) extended resistance into 1870s-1880s by mastering these technologies. However, horses and rifles were originally unknown to Americas—brought by Europeans, not developed independently. Initial Americas conquest occurred before native acquisition of these technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Technology transfer: horses, rifles acquired from Europeans allowed Native Americans to narrow military gap. Plains Indians famous for mounted warfare—but technology borrowed, not invented. Technology acquisition too late: Spanish already conquered empires before native technology adoption.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Custer's Little Big Horn (1876): Sioux with horses/rifles defeating U.S. Army. But this represents late-stage technology acquisition. Earlier Spanish conquests (1500s-1600s) occurred when Native Americans lacked horse/gun technology entirely.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Technology initially unavailable in Americas due to geographic isolation. Horses, guns developed in Eurasia from geographic advantages (domesticable animals, Old World fauna). Americas' geographic difference created technology gap. Even when Native Americans acquired technologies via contact, development trajectory already determined by early conquest.</p>
