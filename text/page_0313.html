                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Tasmania archaeological record shows technology loss: fishing disappeared around 1500 B.C., bone tools (awls, needles) also disappeared. Three smaller islands (Flinders, Kangaroo, King) isolated by rising sea levels ~10,000 years ago: initial populations 200-400 all went extinct. Geographic isolation through water barriers combined with small initial population created extinction threshold. Population below viable knowledge transmission size could not maintain technological knowledge over generations. Rising sea level geography-created isolation destroyed populations maintaining complex technologies.</p>

                    <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
                    <p>Population size determines technology survival. Small populations cannot maintain complex technological knowledge across generations. Geographic isolation through water barriers reduces viable population. Population isolation multiplies extinction risk. Knowledge loss in isolated populations creates technology abandonment. Minimum population size for technology transmission geography-determined through isolation degree.</p>

                    <h3>Historical & Geographic Context</h3>
                    <p>Tasmania: separated from Australia ~10,000 years ago by water barrier, fishing technology maintained but later abandoned. Small islands: populations 200-400 isolated completely, extinction occurred. Comparison: Australia with larger population maintained fishing; Tasmania medium population lost technology; islands tiny populations went extinct. Population size inversely correlated with extinction risk and knowledge loss.</p>

                    <h3>Connection to Main Thesis</h3>
                    <p>Geographic water barriers determine population isolation determine population size determine knowledge survival. Rising sea levels geography-created isolation created population thresholds for extinction. Technology loss geographic consequence through isolation-created small populations. Tasmania/island extinctions demonstrate geography determines civilization sustainability through population viability. Isolation geography-determined technology knowledge persistence.</p>
