THE BIGGEST POPULATION SHIFT OF MODERN TIMES HAS
been the colonization of the New World by Europeans, and the
resulting conquest, numerical reduction, or complete disappearance of
most groups of Native Americans (American Indians). As I explained in
Chapter 1, the New World was initially colonized around or before 11,000
B.c. by way of Alaska, the Bering Strait, and Siberia. Complex agricultural
societies gradually arose in the Americas far to the south of that entry
route, developing in complete isolation from the emerging complex socie
ties of the Old World. After that initial colonization from Asia, the sole
well-attested further contacts between the New World and Asia involved
only hunter-gatherers living on opposite sides of the Bering Strait, plus an
inferred transpacific voyage that introduced the sweet potato from South
America to Polynesia.
As for contacts of New World peoples with Europe, the sole early ones
involved the Norse who occupied Greenland in very small numbers
between A.D. 986 and about 1500. But those Norse visits had no discern
ible impact on Native American societies. Instead, for practical purposes
the collision of advanced Old World and New World societies began
abruptly in A.D. 1492, with Christopher Columbus's "discovery" of Carib
bean islands densely populated by Native Americans.
