reference on Native Americans of North America is Philip Kopper, The
Smithsonian Book of North American Indians before the Coming of the
Europeans (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1986). Bruce
Smith, "The origins of agriculture in the Americas," Evolutionary Anthro
pology 3:174-84 (1995), discusses the controversy over early versus late
dates for the onset of New World food production.
Anyone inclined to believe that New World food production and socie
ties were limited by the culture or psychology of Native Americans them
selves, rather than by limitations of the wild species available to them for
domestication, should consult three accounts of the transformation of
Great Plains Indian societies by the arrival of the horse: Frank Row, The
Indian and the Horse (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1955),
John Ewers, The Blackfeet: Raiders on the Northwestern Plains (Norman:
University of Oklahoma Press, 1958), and Ernest Wallace and E. Adamson
Hoebel, The Comanches: Lords of the South Plains (Norman: University
of Oklahoma Press, 1986).
Among discussions of the spread of language families in relation to the
rise of food production, a classic account for Europe is Albert Ammerman
and L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, The Neolithic Transition and the Genetics of
Populations in Europe (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), while
Peter Bellwood, "The Austronesian dispersal and the origin of languages,"
Scientific American 265(l):88-93 (1991), does the same for the Austrone
sian realm. Studies citing examples from around the world are the two
books by L. L. Cavalli-Sforza et al. and the book by Merritt Ruhlen cited
as further readings for the Prologue. Two books with diametrically
opposed interpretations of the Indo-European expansion provide
