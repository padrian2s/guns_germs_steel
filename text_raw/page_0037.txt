Figure 1.1. The spread of humans around the world.
Europe stems from around half a million years ago, but there are claims
of an earlier presence. One would certainly assume that the colonization
of Asia also permitted the simultaneous colonization of Europe, since
Eurasia is a single landmass not bisected by major barriers.
That illustrates an issue that will recur throughout this book. Whenever
some scientist claims to have discovered "the earliest X"—whether X is
the earliest human fossil in Europe, the earliest evidence of domesticated
corn in Mexico, or the earliest anything anywhere—that announcement
challenges other scientists to beat the claim by finding something still ear
lier. In reality, there must be some truly "earliest X," with all claims of
earlier X's being false. However, as we shall see, for virtually any X, every
year brings forth new discoveries and claims of a purported still earlier X,
along with refutations of some or all of previous years' claims of earlier
X. It often takes decades of searching before archaeologists reach a con
sensus on such questions.
By about half a million years ago, human fossils had diverged from
older Homo erectus skeletons in their enlarged, rounder, and less angular
skulls. African and European skulls of half a million years ago were suffi
ciently similar to skulls of us moderns that they are classified in our spe
cies, Homo sapiens, instead of in Homo erectus. This distinction is
