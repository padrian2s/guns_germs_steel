included ones dependent on stone tools, as were Polynesians, South
America also spawned societies expert in using precious metals, and Eur
asians and Africans went on to utilize iron. Those developments were pre
cluded in Polynesia, because no Polynesian island except New Zealand
had significant metal deposits. Eurasia had full-fledged empires before
Polynesia was even settled, and South America and Mesoamerica devel
oped empires later, whereas Polynesia produced just two proto-empires,
one of which (Hawaii) coalesced only after the arrival of Europeans.
Eurasia and Mesoamerica developed indigenous writing, which failed to
emerge in Polynesia, except perhaps on Easter Island, whose mysterious
script may however have postdated the islanders' contact with Europeans.
That is, Polynesia offers us a small slice, not the full spectrum, of the
world's human social diversity. That shouldn't surprise us, since Polynesia
provides only a small slice of the world's geographic diversity. In addition,
since Polynesia was colonized so late in human history, even the oldest
Polynesian societies had only 3,200 years in which to develop, as opposed
to at least 13,000 years for societies on even the last-colonized continents
(the Americas). Given a few more millennia, perhaps Tonga and Hawaii
would have reached the level of full-fledged empires battling each other
for control of the Pacific, with indigenously developed writing to adminis
ter those empires, while New Zealand's Maori might have added copper
and iron tools to their repertoire of jade and other materials.
In short, Polynesia furnishes us with a convincing example of environ
mentally related diversification of human societies in operation. But we
thereby learn only that it can happen, because it happened in Polynesia.
Did it also happen on the continents? If so, what were the environmental
differences responsible for diversification on the continents, and what were
their consequences?
