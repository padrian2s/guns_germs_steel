Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, Jr., The Diario of Christopher Columbus's
First Voyage to America, 1492-1493 (Norman: University of Oklahoma
Press, 1989).
As an antidote to this book's mostly dispassionate account of how peo
ples conquered or slaughtered other peoples, read the classic account of
the destruction of the Yahi tribelet of northern California and the emer
gence of Ishi, its solitary survivor: Theodora Kroeber, Ishi in Two Worlds
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1961). The disappearance of
native languages in the Americas and elsewhere is the subject of Robert
Robins and Eugenius Uhlenbeck, Endangered Languages (Providence:
Berg, 1991), Joshua Fishman, Reversing Language Shift (Clevedon: Multi
lingual Matters, 1991), and Michael Krauss, "The world's languages in
crisis," Language 68:4-10 (1992).
