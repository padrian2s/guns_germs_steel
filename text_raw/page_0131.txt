E HAVE JUST SEEN HOW PEOPLES OF SOME REGIONS
began to cultivate wild plant species, a step with momentous
unforeseen consequences for their lifestyle and their descendants' place in
history. Let us now return to our questions: Why did agriculture never
arise independently in some fertile and highly suitable areas, such as Cali
fornia, Europe, temperate Australia, and subequatorial Africa? Why,
among the areas where agriculture did arise independently, did it develop
much earlier in some than in others?
Two contrasting explanations suggest themselves: problems with the
local people, or problems with the locally available wild plants. On the
one hand, perhaps almost any well-watered temperate or tropical area of
the globe offers enough species of wild plants suitable for domestication.
In that case, the explanation for agriculture's failure to develop in some of
those areas would lie with cultural characteristics of their peoples. On the
other hand, perhaps at least some humans in any large area of the globe
would have been receptive to the experimentation that led to domestica
tion. Only the lack of suitable wild plants might then explain why food
production did not evolve in some areas.
As we shall see in the next chapter, the corresponding problem for
domestication of big wild mammals proves easier to solve, because there
