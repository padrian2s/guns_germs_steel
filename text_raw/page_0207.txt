close to cows and their feces, urine, breath, sores, and blood. Our intimacy
with cattle has been going on for the 9,000 years since we domesticated
them—ample time for the rinderpest virus to discover us nearby. As Table
11.1 illustrates, others of our familiar infectious diseases can similarly be
traced back to diseases of our animal friends.
GIVEN OUR PROXIMITY to the animals we love, we must be getting
constantly bombarded by their microbes. Those invaders get winnowed by
natural selection, and only a few of them succeed in establishing them
selves as human diseases. A quick survey of current diseases lets us trace
out four stages in the evolution of a specialized human disease from an
animal precursor.
The first stage is illustrated by dozens of diseases that we now and then
pick up directly from our pets and domestic animals. They include cat-
scratch fever from our cats, leptospirosis from our dogs, psittacosis from
our chickens and parrots, and brucellosis from our cattle. We're similarly
liable to pick up diseases from wild animals, such as the tularemia that
hunters can get from skinning wild rabbits. All those microbes are still at
an early stage in their evolution into specialized human pathogens. They
still don't get transmitted directly from one person to another, and even
their transfer to us from animals remains uncommon.
In the second stage a former animal pathogen evolves to the point where
it does get transmitted directly between people and causes epidemics.
