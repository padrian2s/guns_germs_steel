grown foods, it's fun to try eating wild foods. You know that some
wild plants, such as wild strawberries and blueberries, are both tasty and
safe to eat. They're sufficiently similar to familiar crops that you can easily
recognize the wild berries, even though they're much smaller than those
we grow. Adventurous hikers cautiously eat mushrooms, aware that many
species can kill us. But not even ardent nut lovers eat wild almonds, of
which a few dozen contain enough cyanide (the poison used in Nazi gas
chambers) to kill us. The forest is full of many other plants deemed ined
ible.
Yet all crops arose from wild plant species. How did certain wild plants
get turned into crops? That question is especially puzzling in regard to the
many crops (like almonds) whose wild progenitors are lethal or bad-tast
ing, and to other crops (like corn) that look drastically different from their
wild ancestors. What cavewoman or caveman ever got the idea of "domes
ticating" a plant, and how was it accomplished?
Plant domestication may be defined as growing a plant and thereby,
consciously or unconsciously, causing it to change genetically from its wild
ancestor in ways making it more useful to human consumers. Crop devel-
