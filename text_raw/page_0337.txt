Figure 17.1. The Austronesian language family consists of four
subfamilies, three of them confined to Taiwan and one (Malayo-Poly¬
nesian) widespread. The latter subfamily in turn consists of two sub-
subfamilies, Western Malayo-Polynesian (= W M-P) and Central-
Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (= C-E M-P). The latter sub-subfamily in
turn consists of four sub-sub-subfamilies, the very widespread Oce

given ample time for humans to evolve genetic and linguistic diversity and

It is also surprising that Indonesians and Filipinos are so similar to trop-
