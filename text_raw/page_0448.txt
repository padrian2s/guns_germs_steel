Two books on the history of Australia after European colonization are
Robert Hughes, The Fatal Shore (New York: Knopf, 1987), and Michael
Cannon, The Exploration of Australia (Sydney: Reader's Digest, 1987).
Aboriginal Australians themselves are the subject of Richard Broome,
Aboriginal Australians (Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 1982), and Henry
Reynolds, Frontier (Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 1987). An incredibly
detailed history of New Guinea, from the earliest written records until
1902, is the three-volume work by Arthur Wichmann, Entdeckungs-
geschichte von Neu-Guinea (Leiden: Brill, 1909-12). A shorter and more
readable account is Gavin Souter, New Guinea: The Last Unknown (Syd
ney: Angus and Robertson, 1964). Bob Connolly and Robin Anderson,
First Contact (New York: Viking, 1987), movingly describes the first
encounters of highland New Guineans with Europeans.
For detailed accounts of New Guinea's Papuan (i.e., non-Austronesian)
languages, see Stephen Wurm, Papuan Languages of Oceania (Tubingen:
Gunter Narr, 1982), and William Foley, The Papuan Languages of New
Guinea (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986); and of Australian
languages, see Stephen Wurm, Languages of Australia and Tasmania (The
Hague: Mouton, 1972), and R. M. W Dixon, The Languages of Australia
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980).
An entrance into the literature on plant domestication and origins of
food production in New Guinea can be found in Jack Golson, "Bulmer
phase II: Early agriculture in the New Guinea highlands," pp. 484-91 in
Andrew Pawley, ed., Man and a Half (Auckland: Polynesian Society,
1991), and D. E. Yen, "Polynesian cultigens and cultivars: The question of
origin," pp. 67-95 in Paul Cox and Sandra Banack, eds., Islands, Plants,
and Polynesians (Portland: Dioscorides Press, 1991).
Numerous articles and books are devoted to the fascinating problem of
why trading visits of Indonesians and of Torres Strait islanders to Australia
