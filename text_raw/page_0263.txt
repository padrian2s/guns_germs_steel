Eurasia plus North Africa. Africa's north-south axis posed a further obsta
cle to the diffusion of technology, both between Eurasia and sub-Saharan
Africa and within the sub-Saharan region itself. As an illustration of the
latter obstacle, pottery and iron metallurgy arose in or reached sub-
Saharan Africa's Sahel zone (north of the equator) at least as early as they
reached western Europe. However, pottery did not reach the southern tip
of Africa until around A.D. 1, and metallurgy had not yet diffused overland
to the southern tip by the time that it arrived there from Europe on ships.
Finally, Australia is the smallest continent. The very low rainfall and
productivity of most of Australia makes it effectively even smaller as
regards its capacity to support human populations. It is also the most iso
lated continent. In addition, food production never arose indigenously in
Australia. Those factors combined to leave Australia the sole continent
still without metal artifacts in modern times.
Table 13.1 translates these factors into numbers, by comparing the con
tinents with respect to their areas and their modern human populations.
The continents' populations 10,000 years ago, just before the rise of food
production, are not known but surely stood in the same sequence, since
many of the areas producing the most food today would also have been
productive areas for hunter-gatherers 10,000 years ago. The differences in
population are glaring: Eurasia's (including North Africa's) is nearly 6
times that of the Americas, nearly 8 times that of Africa's, and 230 times
that of Australia's. Larger populations mean more inventors and more
competing societies. Table 13.1 by itself goes a long way toward
explaining the origins of guns and steel in Eurasia.
All these effects that continental differences in area, population, ease of
