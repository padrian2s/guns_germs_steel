standing examples are the persistence of Native American hunter-gather
ers in California, separated by deserts from the Native American farmers
of Arizona; that of Khoisan hunter-gatherers at the Cape of South Africa,
in a Mediterranean climate zone unsuitable for the equatorial crops of
nearby Bantu farmers; and that of hunter-gatherers throughout the Aus
tralian continent, separated by narrow seas from the food producers of
Indonesia and New Guinea. Those few peoples who remained hunter-
gatherers into the 20th century escaped replacement by food producers
because they were confined to areas not fit for food production, especially
deserts and Arctic regions. Within the present decade, even they will have
been seduced by the attractions of civilization, settled down under pressure
from bureaucrats or missionaries, or succumbed to germs.
