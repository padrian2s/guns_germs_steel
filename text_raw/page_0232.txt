case of Chinese writing. Hieroglyphic writing appeared rather suddenly, in
nearly full-blown form, around 3000 B.C. Egypt lay only 800 miles west
of Sumer, with which Egypt had trade contacts. I find it suspicious that no
evidence of a gradual development of hieroglyphs has come down to us,
even though Egypt's dry climate would have been favorable for preserving
earlier experiments in writing, and though the similarly dry climate of
Sumer has yielded abundant evidence of the development of Sumerian
cuneiform for at least several centuries before 3000 B.C. Equally suspicious
is the appearance of several other, apparently independently designed,
writing systems in Iran, Crete, and Turkey (so-called proto-Elamite writ
ing, Cretan pictographs, and Hieroglyphic Hittite, respectively), after the
rise of Sumerian and Egyptian writing. Although each of those systems
used distinctive sets of signs not borrowed from Egypt or Sumer, the peo
ples involved could hardly have been unaware of the writing of their neigh
boring trade partners.
It would be a remarkable coincidence if, after millions of years of
human existence without writing, all those Mediterranean and Near East
ern societies had just happened to hit independently on the idea of writing
within a few centuries of each other. Hence a possible interpretation seems
to me idea diffusion, as in the case of Sequoyah's syllabary. That is, Egyp
tians and other peoples may have learned from Sumerians about the idea
