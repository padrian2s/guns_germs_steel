saw in Chapter 5, there were no more than nine areas of the globe, perhaps
as few as five, where food production arose independently. Yet, already in
prehistoric times, food production became established in many other
regions besides those few areas of origins. All those other areas became
food producing as a result of the spread of crops, livestock, and knowledge
of how to grow them and, in some cases, as a result of migrations of farm
ers and herders themselves.
The main such spreads of food production were from Southwest Asia
to Europe, Egypt and North Africa, Ethiopia, Central Asia, and the Indus
Valley; from the Sahel and West Africa to East and South Africa; from
China to tropical Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Korea, and
Japan; and from Mesoamerica to North America. Moreover, food produc
tion even in its areas of origin became enriched by the addition of crops,
livestock, and techniques from other areas of origin.
Just as some regions proved much more suitable than others for the
origins of food production, the ease of its spread also varied greatly
around the world. Some areas that are ecologically very suitable for food
production never acquired it in prehistoric times at all, even though areas
of prehistoric food production existed nearby. The most conspicuous such
examples are the failure of both farming and herding to reach Native
