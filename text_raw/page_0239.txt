NECESSITY'S M O T H ER

N JULY 3, 1908, ARCHAEOLOGISTS EXCAVATING THE
ancient Minoan palace at Phaistos, on the island of Crete,
chanced upon one of the most remarkable objects in the history of technol
ogy. At first glance it seemed unprepossessing: just a small, flat, unpainted,
circular disk of hard-baked clay, 6V2 inches in diameter. Closer examina
tion showed each side to be covered with writing, resting on a curved line
that spiraled clockwise in five coils from the disk's rim to its center. A total
of 241 signs or letters was neatly divided by etched vertical lines into
groups of several signs, possibly constituting words. The writer must have
planned and executed the disk with care, so as to start writing at the rim
and fill up all the available space along the spiraling line, yet not run out
of space on reaching the center (page 240).
Ever since it was unearthed, the disk has posed a mystery for historians
of writing. The number of distinct signs (45) suggests a syllabary rather
than an alphabet, but it is still undeciphered, and the forms of the signs
are unlike those of any other known writing system. Not another scrap of
the strange script has turned up in the 89 years since its discovery. Thus, it
remains unknown whether it represents an indigenous Cretan script or a
foreign import to Crete.
For historians of technology, the Phaistos disk is even more baffling; its
