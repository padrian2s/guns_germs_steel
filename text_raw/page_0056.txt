tion, the Chathams are relatively small and remote islands, capable of sup
porting a total population of only about 2,000 hunter-gatherers. With no
other accessible islands to colonize, the Moriori had to remain in the Chat-
hams, and to learn how to get along with each other. They did so by
renouncing war, and they reduced potential conflicts from overpopulation
by castrating some male infants. The result was a small, unwarlike popula
tion with simple technology and weapons, and without strong leadership
or organization.
In contrast, the northern (warmer) part of New Zealand, by far the
largest island group in Polynesia, was suitable for Polynesian agriculture.
Those Maori who remained in New Zealand increased in numbers until
there were more than 100,000 of them. They developed locally dense pop
ulations chronically engaged in ferocious wars with neighboring popula
tions. With the crop surpluses that they could grow and store, they fed
craft specialists, chiefs, and part-time soldiers. They needed and developed
varied tools for growing their crops, fighting, and making art. They erected
elaborate ceremonial buildings and prodigious numbers of forts.
