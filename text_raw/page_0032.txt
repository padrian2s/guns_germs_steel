of the answer to Yali's question. Recognition of those factors emphasizes
the unexplained residue, whose understanding will be a task for the future.
The Epilogue, entitled "The Future of Human History as a Science,"
lays out some pieces of the residue, including the problem of the differ
ences between different parts of Eurasia, the role of cultural factors unre
lated to environment, and the role of individuals. Perhaps the biggest of
these unsolved problems is to establish human history as a historical sci
ence, on a par with recognized historical sciences such as evolutionary
biology, geology, and climatology. The study of human history does pose
real difficulties, but those recognized historical sciences encounter some of
the same challenges. Hence the methods developed in some of these other
fields may also prove useful in the field of human history.
Already, though, I hope to have convinced you, the reader, that history
is not "just one damn fact after another," as a cynic put it. There really
are broad patterns to history, and the search for their explanation is as
productive as it is fascinating.
