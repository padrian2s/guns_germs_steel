include "Contributions of radiocarbon dating to the geochronology of the
peopling of the New World," pp. 354-74 in R. E. Taylor, A. Long, and
R. S. Kra, eds., Radiocarbon after Four Decades (New York: Springer,

36 in Olga Soffer and N. D. Praslov, eds., From Kostenki to Clovis: Upper
Paleolithic Paleo-Indian Adaptations (New York: Plenum, 1993). Pre-Clo

brias, "Carbon-14 dates point to man in the Americas 32,000 years ago,"
Nature 321:769-71 (1986), and David Meltzer et al., "On a Pleistocene
human occupation at Pedra Furada, Brazil," Antiquity 68:695-714
(1994). Other publications relevant to the pre-Clovis debate include T. D.

Two outstanding books explicitly concerned with cultural differences
among Polynesian islands are Patrick Kirch, The Evolution of the Polyne
sian Chiefdoms (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984), and the
same author's The Wet and the Dry (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
1994). Much of Peter Bellwood's The Polynesians, rev. ed. (London:
Thames and Hudson, 1987), also deals with this problem. Notable books
dealing with specific Polynesian islands include Michael King, Moriori
(Auckland: Penguin, 1989), on the Chatham Islands, Patrick Kirch, Feath
ered Gods and Fishhooks (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1985),
on Hawaii, Patrick Kirch and Marshall Sahlins, Anahulu (Chicago: Uni
versity of Chicago Press, 1992), also on Hawaii, Jo Anne Van Tilburg,
Easter Island (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1994),
