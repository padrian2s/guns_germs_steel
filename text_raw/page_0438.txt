Michigan Museum of Anthropology, 1985); and R. G. Matson, The Ori
gins of Southwestern Agriculture (Tucson: University of Arizona Press,
1991). Bruce Smith, "The origins of agriculture in the Americas," Evolu
tionary Anthropology 3:174-84 (1995), discusses the revisionist view,
based on accelerator mass spectrometry dating of very small plant samples,
that the origins of agriculture in the Americas were much more recent than
previously believed.
The following are accounts of animal domestication and livestock in
specific parts of the world. For central and eastern Europe: S. Bokonyi,
History of Domestic Mammals in Central and Eastern Europe (Budapest:
Akademiai Kiado, 1974). For Africa: Andrew Smith, Pastoralism in Africa
(London: Hurst, 1992). For the Andes: Elizabeth Wing, "Domestication
of Andean mammals," pp. 246-64 in F. Vuilleumier and M. Monasterio,
eds., High Altitude Tropical Biogeography (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1986).
References on specific important crops include the following. Thomas
Sodestrom et al., eds., Grass Systematics and Evolution (Washington,
D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1987), is a comprehensive multi-
author account of grasses, the plant group that gave rise to our cereals,
now the world's most important crops. Hugh litis, "From teosinte to
maize: The catastrophic sexual transmutation," Science 222:886-94
(1983), gives an account of the drastic changes in reproductive biology
involved in the evolution of corn from teosinte, its wild ancestor. Yan
Wenming, "China's earliest rice agricultural remains," Indo-Pacific Prehis
tory Association Bulletin 10:118-26 (1991), discusses early rice domesti
cation in South China. Two books by Charles Heiser, Jr., are popular
accounts of particular crops: The Sunflower (Norman: University of Okla
homa Press, 1976) and The Gourd Book (Norman: University of Okla
homa Press, 1979).
Many papers or books are devoted to accounts of particular domesti
cated animal species. R. T. Loftus et al., "Evidence for two independent
domestications of cattle," Proceedings of the National Academy of Sci
ences U.S.A. 91:2757-61 (1994), uses evidence from mitochondrial DNA
to demonstrate that cattle were domesticated independently in western
Eurasia and in the Indian subcontinent. For horses: Juliet Clutton-Brock,
Horse Power (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1992), Richard
Meadow and Hans-Peter Uerpmann, eds., Equids in the Ancient World
(Wiesbaden: Reichert, 1986), Matthew J. Kust, Man and Horse in History
