HEMISPHERES COLLIDING

HE LARGEST POPULATION REPLACEMENT OF THE LAST

of Spaniards captured the Inca emperor Atahuallpa, absolute ruler of the
largest, richest, most populous, and administratively and technologically
most advanced Native American state. Atahuallpa's capture symbolizes
the European conquest of the Americas, because the same mix of proxi
mate factors that caused it was also responsible for European conquests of
other Native American societies. Let us now return to that collision of
hemispheres, applying what we have learned since Chapter 3. The basic
question to be answered is: why did Europeans reach and conquer the
lands of Native Americans, instead of vice versa? Our starting point will
be a comparison of Eurasian and Native American societies as of A.D.
1492, the year of Columbus's "discovery" of the Americas.
OUR COMPARISON BEGINS with food production, a major determi
nant of local population size and societal complexity—hence an ultimate
factor behind the conquest. The most glaring difference between American
