THIS BOOK ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY OF
everybody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the
book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents? In case
this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are
about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers
to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's
emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back
the chain of historical causation as far as possible.
Most books that set out to recount world history concentrate on histor
ies of literate Eurasian and North African societies. Native societies of
other parts of the world—sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Island South
east Asia, Australia, New Guinea, the Pacific Islands—receive only brief
treatment, mainly as concerns what happened to them very late in their
history, after they were discovered and subjugated by western Europeans.
Even within Eurasia, much more space gets devoted to the history of west
ern Eurasia than of China, India, Japan, tropical Southeast Asia, and other
eastern Eurasian societies. History before the emergence of writing around
3,000 B.C. also receives brief treatment, although it constitutes 99.9% of
the five-million-year history of the human species.
Such narrowly focused accounts of world history suffer from three dis
advantages. First, increasing numbers of people today are, quite under
standably, interested in other societies besides those of western Eurasia.
After all, those "other" societies encompass most of the world's popula
tion and the vast majority of the world's ethnic, cultural, and linguistic
