TABLE 8.I World Distribution of Large-Seeded Grass Species
Table 12.1 of Mark Blunder's Ph.D. dissertation, "Seed Weight and Environment in Medi
terranean-type Grasslands in California and Israel" (University of California, Berkeley,
1992), listed the world's 56 heaviest-seeded wild grass species (excluding bamboos) for which
data were available. Grain weight in those species ranged from 10 milligrams to over 40
milligrams, about 10 times greater than the median value for all of the world's grass species.
Those 56 species make up less than 1 percent of the world's grass species. This table shows
that these prize grasses are overwhelmingly concentrated in the Mediterranean zone of west
ern Eurasia.
it provides a wide range of altitudes and topographies within a short dis
tance. Its range of elevations, from the lowest spot on Earth (the Dead
Sea) to mountains of 18,000 feet (near Teheran), ensures a corresponding
variety of environments, hence a high diversity of the wild plants serving
as potential ancestors of crops. Those mountains are in proximity to gentle
lowlands with rivers, flood plains, and deserts suitable for irrigation agri
culture. In contrast, the Mediterranean zones of southwestern Australia
and, to a lesser degree, of South Africa and western Europe offer a nar
rower range of altitudes, habitats, and topographies.
The range of altitudes in the Fertile Crescent meant staggered harvest
seasons: plants at higher elevations produced seeds somewhat later than
plants at lower elevations. As a result, hunter-gatherers could move up
a mountainside harvesting grain seeds as they matured, instead of being
overwhelmed by a concentrated harvest season at a single altitude, where
all grains matured simultaneously. When cultivation began, it was a simple
