A painting of the Rajasthani or Gujarati school, from the Indian subcon
tinent in the early 17th century. The script, like most other modern
Indian scripts, is derived from ancient India's Brahmi script, which was
probably derived in turn by idea diffusion from the Aramaic alphabet
around the seventh century B.C. Indian scripts incorporated the alpha
betic principle but independently devised letter forms, letter sequence,
and vowel treatment without resort to blueprint copying.
