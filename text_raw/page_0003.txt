a summary of human history that can be accounted, for the time being,
as Darwinian in its authority." —Thomas M. Disch, New Leader
"A wonderfully engrossing book. . . . Jared Diamond takes us on an
exhilarating world tour of history that makes us rethink all our ideas
about ourselves and other peoples and our places in the overall scheme
of things." —Christopher Ehret, Professor of African History, UCLA
"Jared Diamond masterfully draws together recent discoveries in fields of
inquiry as diverse as archaeology and epidemiology, as he illuminates
how and why the human societies of different continents followed widely
divergent pathways of development over the past 13,000 years."
—Bruce D. Smith, Director, Archaeobiology Program,
Smithsonian Institution
"The question, 'Why did human societies have such diverse fates?' has
usually received racist answers. Mastering information from many differ
ent fields, Jared Diamond convincingly demonstrates that head starts and
local conditions can explain much of the course of human history. His
impressive account will appeal to a vast readership."
—Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Professor of Genetics, Stanford University
