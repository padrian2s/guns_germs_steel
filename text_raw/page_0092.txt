92 • GUNS, GERMS, AND STEEL
Of equal importance in wars of conquest were the germs that evolved in
human societies with domestic animals. Infectious diseases like smallpox,
measles, and flu arose as specialized germs of humans, derived by muta
tions of very similar ancestral germs that had infected animals (Chapter
11). The humans who domesticated animals were the first to fall victim
to the newly evolved germs, but those humans then evolved substantial
resistance to the new diseases. When such partly immune people came
into contact with others who had had no previous exposure to the germs,
epidemics resulted in which up to 99 percent of the previously unexposed
population was killed. Germs thus acquired ultimately from domestic ani
mals played decisive roles in the European conquests of Native Americans,
Australians, South Africans, and Pacific islanders.
In short, plant and animal domestication meant much more food and
hence much denser human populations. The resulting food surpluses, and
(in some areas) the animal-based means of transporting those surpluses,
were a prerequisite for the development of settled, politically centralized,
socially stratified, economically complex, technologically innovative socie
ties. Hence the availability of domestic plants and animals ultimately
explains why empires, literacy, and steel weapons developed earliest in
Eurasia and later, or not at all, on other continents. The military uses of
horses and camels, and the killing power of animal-derived germs, com
plete the list of major links between food production and conquest that
we shall be exploring.
