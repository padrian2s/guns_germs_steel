E HAVE NOW TRACED HOW FOOD PRODUCTION AROSE
in a few centers, and how it spread at unequal rates from there
to other areas. Those geographic differences constitute important ultimate
answers to Yali's question about why different peoples ended up with dis
parate degrees of power and affluence. However, food production itself is
not a proximate cause. In a one-on-one fight, a naked farmer would have
no advantage over a naked hunter-gatherer.
Instead, one part of the explanation for farmer power lies in the much
denser populations that food production could support: ten naked farmers
certainly would have an advantage over one naked hunter-gatherer in a
fight. The other part is that neither farmers nor hunter-gatherers are
naked, at least not figuratively. Farmers tend to breathe out nastier germs,
to own better weapons and armor, to own more-powerful technology in
general, and to live under centralized governments with literate elites bet
ter able to wage wars of conquest. Hence the next four chapters will
explore how the ultimate cause of food production led to the proximate
causes of germs, literacy, technology, and centralized government.
The links connecting livestock and crops to germs were unforgettably
illustrated for me by a hospital case about which I learned through a physi
cian friend. When my friend was an inexperienced young doctor, he was
