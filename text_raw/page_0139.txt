daily high percentage of annual plants. The combination of these two fac
tors—a high diversity of species and a high percentage of annuals—means
that western Eurasia's Mediterranean zone is the one with by far the high
est diversity of annuals.
The significance of that botanical wealth for humans is illustrated by
the geographer Mark Blunder's studies of wild grass distributions. Among
the world's thousands of wild grass species, Blumler tabulated the 56 with
the largest seeds, the cream of nature's crop: the grass species with seeds
at least 10 times heavier than the median grass species (see Table 8.1).
Virtually all of them are native to Mediterranean zones or other seasonally
dry environments. Furthermore, they are overwhelmingly concentrated in
the Fertile Crescent or other parts of western Eurasia's Mediterranean
zone, which offered a huge selection to incipient farmers: about 32 of the
world's 56 prize wild grasses! Specifically, barley and emmer wheat, the
two earliest important crops of the Fertile Crescent, rank respectively 3rd
and 13th in seed size among those top 56. In contrast, the Mediterranean
zone of Chile offered only two of those species, California and southern
Africa just one each, and southwestern Australia none at all. That fact
alone goes a long way toward explaining the course of human history.
A third advantage of the Fertile Crescent's Mediterranean zone is that
