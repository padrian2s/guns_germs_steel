ORMERLY, ALL PEOPLE ON EARTH WERE HUNTER-GATHER-

they must have had some reason, why did they do so around 8500 B.C. in
Mediterranean habitats of the Fertile Crescent, only 3,000 years later in
the climatically and structurally similar Mediterranean habitats of south
western Europe, and never indigenously in the similar Mediterranean hab

Why did even people of the Fertile Crescent wait until 8500 B.C., instead
of becoming food producers already around 18,500 or 28,500 B.C.?
From our modern perspective, all these questions at first seem silly,
because the drawbacks of being a hunter-gatherer appear so obvious. Sci
entists used to quote a phrase of Thomas Hobbes's in order to characterize
the lifestyle of hunter-gatherers as "nasty, brutish, and short." They
seemed to have to work hard, to be driven by the daily quest for food,
