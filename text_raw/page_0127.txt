The table gives major crops, of five crop classes, from early agricultural sites in various
parts of the world. Square brackets enclose names of crops first domesticated elsewhere;
names not enclosed in brackets refer to local domesticates. Omitted are crops that arrived or
became important only later, such as bananas in Africa, corn and beans in the eastern United
States, and sweet potato in New Guinea. Cottons are four species of the genus Gossypium,
each species being native to a particular part of the world; squashes are five species of the
genus Cucurbita. Note that cereals, pulses, and fiber crops launched agriculture in most
areas, but that root and tuber crops and melons were of early importance in only some areas.
