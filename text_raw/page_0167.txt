TABLE 9.3 Approximate Dates of First Attested Evidence for
Domestication of Large Mammal Species
For the other four domesticated large mammal species—reindeer, yak, gaur, and ban-
teng—there is as yet little evidence concerning the date of domestication. Dates and places
shown are merely the earliest ones attested to date; domestication may actually have begun
earlier and at a different location.
of ancient humans. Europeans today are heirs to one of the longest tradi
tions of animal domestication on Earth—that which began in Southwest
Asia around 10,000 years ago. Since the fifteenth century, Europeans have
spread around the globe and encountered wild mammal species not found
in Europe. European settlers, such as those that I encounter in New Guinea
with pet kangaroos and possums, have tamed or made pets of many local
mammals, just as have indigenous peoples. European herders and farmers
emigrating to other continents have also made serious efforts to domesti
cate some local species.
In the 19th and 20th centuries at least six large mammals—the eland,
elk, moose, musk ox, zebra, and American bison—have been the subjects
of especially well-organized projects aimed at domestication, carried out
by modern scientific animal breeders and geneticists. For example, eland,
the largest African antelope, have been undergoing selection for meat qual
ity and milk quantity in the Askaniya-Nova Zoological Park in the
