Y
ALI'S QUESTION WENT TO THE HEART OF THE CURRENT
human condition, and of post-Pleistocene human history. Now that
we have completed this brief tour over the continents, how shall we
answer Yali?
I would say to Yali: the striking differences between the long-term his
tories of peoples of the different continents have been due not to innate
differences in the peoples themselves but to differences in their environ
ments. I expect that if the populations of Aboriginal Australia and Eurasia
could have been interchanged during the Late Pleistocene, the original
Aboriginal Australians would now be the ones occupying most of the
Americas and Australia, as well as Eurasia, while the original Aboriginal
Eurasians would be the ones now reduced to downtrodden population
fragments in Australia. One might at first be inclined to dismiss this asser

about its outcome cannot be verified. But historians are nevertheless able
to evaluate related hypotheses by retrospective tests. For instance, one can
examine what did happen when European farmers were transplanted to
Greenland or the U.S. Great Plains, and when farmers stemming ultimately
from China emigrated to the Chatham Islands, the rain forests of Borneo,
or the volcanic soils of Java or Hawaii. These tests confirm that the same
