Eurasia and China, respectively? In addition, one is ignoring the fact that
Confucian China was technologically more advanced than western
Eurasia until about A.D. 1400.
It is impossible to understand even just western Eurasian societies them
selves, if one focuses on them. The interesting questions concern the dis
tinctions between them and other societies. Answering those questions
requires us to understand all those other societies as well, so that western
Eurasian societies can be fitted into the broader context.
Some readers may feel that I am going to the opposite extreme from
conventional histories, by devoting too little space to western Eurasia at
the expense of other parts of the world. I would answer that some other
parts of the world are very instructive, because they encompass so many
societies and such diverse societies within a small geographical area. Other
readers may find themselves agreeing with one reviewer of this book. With
mildly critical tongue in cheek, the reviewer wrote that I seem to view
world history as an onion, of which the modern world constitutes only the
surface, and whose layers are to be peeled back in the search for historical
understanding. Yes, world history is indeed such an onion! But that peeling
back of the onion's layers is fascinating, challenging—and of overwhelm
ing importance to us today, as we seek to grasp our past's lessons for our
future.
