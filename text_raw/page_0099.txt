Figure 5.1. Centers of origin of food production. A question mark indi
cates some uncertainty whether the rise of food production at that center
was really uninfluenced by the spread of food production from other cen
ters, or (in the case of New Guinea) what the earliest crops were.
nous wild plants in Ethiopia. As for New Guinea, archaeological studies
there have provided evidence of early agriculture well before food produc
tion in any adjacent areas, but the crops grown have not been definitely
identified.
Table 5.1 summarizes, for these and other areas of local domestication,
some of the best-known crops and animals and the earliest known dates
of domestication. Among these nine candidate areas for the independent
evolution of food production, Southwest Asia has the earliest definite dates
for both plant domestication (around 8500 B.C.) and animal domestica
tion (around 8000 B.c.); it also has by far the largest number of accurate
radiocarbon dates for early food production. Dates for China are nearly
as early, while dates for the eastern United States are clearly about 6,000
years later. For the other six candidate areas, the earliest well-established
dates do not rival those for Southwest Asia, but too few early sites have
been securely dated in those six other areas for us to be certain that they
really lagged behind Southwest Asia and (if so) by how much.
The next group of areas consists of ones that did domesticate at least a
