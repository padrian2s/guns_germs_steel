constitute a perfectly controlled experiment in the evolution of human
societies, forcing us to a simple racist conclusion?
The resolution of this problem is simple. White English colonists did
not create a literate, food-producing, industrial democracy in Australia.
Instead, they imported all of the elements from outside Australia: the live
stock, all of the crops (except macadamia nuts), the metallurgical knowl
edge, the steam engines, the guns, the alphabet, the political institutions,
even the germs. All these were the end products of 10,000 years of devel
opment in Eurasian environments. By an accident of geography, the colo
nists who landed at Sydney in 1788 inherited those elements. Europeans
have never learned to survive in Australia or New Guinea without their
inherited Eurasian technology. Robert Burke and William Wills were smart
enough to write, but not smart enough to survive in Australian desert
regions where Aborigines were living.
The people who did create a society in Australia were Aboriginal Aus
tralians. Of course, the society that they created was not a literate, food-
producing, industrial democracy. The reasons follow straightforwardly
from features of the Australian environment.
