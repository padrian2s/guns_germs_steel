John Varner and Jeannette Varner, Dogs of the Conquest (Norman: Uni
versity of Oklahoma Press, 1983), describes the Spaniards' use of dogs as
military weapons to kill Indians during the Spanish conquests of the Amer
icas. Clive Spinnage, The Natural History of Antelopes (New York: Facts
on File, 1986), gives an account of the biology of antelopes, and hence a
starting point for trying to understand why none of these seemingly obvi
ous candidates for domestication was actually domesticated. Derek Good
win, Domestic Birds (London: Museum Press, 1965), summarizes the bird
species that have been domesticated, and R. A. Donkin, The Muscovy
Duck Cairina moschata domestica (Rotterdam: Balkema, 1989), discusses
one of the sole two bird species domesticated in the New World.

For a gripping account of the impact of disease on a human population,
nothing can match Thucydides' account of the plague of Athens, in book
2 of his Peloponnesian War (available in many translations).
Three classic accounts of disease in history are Hans Zinsser, Rats, Lice,
and History (Boston: Little, Brown, 1935), Geddes Smith, A Plague on Us
(New York: Commonwealth Fund, 1941), and William McNeill, Plagues
