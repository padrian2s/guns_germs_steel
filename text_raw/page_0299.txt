Figure 15.1. Map of the region from Southeast Asia to Australia and
New Guinea. Solid lines denote the present coastline; the dashed lines are
the coastline during Pleistocene times when sea level dropped to below
its present stand—that is, the edge of the Asian and Greater Australian
shelves. At that time, New Guinea and Australia were joined in an
expanded Greater Australia, while Borneo, Java, Sumatra, and Taiwan
were part of the Asian mainland.
