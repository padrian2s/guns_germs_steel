farther and farther removed from the Fertile Crescent, to the west and
east. On this page I have redrawn the striking map (Figure 10.2) assembled
by the geneticist Daniel Zohary and botanist Maria Hopf, in which they
illustrate how the wave had reached Greece and Cyprus and the Indian
subcontinent by 6500 B.C., Egypt soon after 6000 B.C., central Europe by
5400 B.c., southern Spain by 5200 B.C., and Britain around 3500 B.c. In
each of those areas, food production was initiated by some of the same
suite of domestic plants and animals that launched it in the Fertile Cres
cent. In addition, the Fertile Crescent package penetrated Africa south
ward to Ethiopia at some still-uncertain date. However, Ethiopia also
developed many indigenous crops, and we do not yet know whether it was
these crops or the arriving Fertile Crescent crops that launched Ethiopian
food production.

remains of Fertile Crescent crops have been found. • = the Fertile Cres
cent itself (sites before 7000 B.C.). Note that dates become progressively
later as one gets farther from the Fertile Crescent. This map is based on
Map 20 of Zohary and Hopf's Domestication of Plants in the Old World
but substitutes calibrated radiocarbon dates for their uncalibrated dates.
