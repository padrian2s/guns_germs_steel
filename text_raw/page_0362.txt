TABLE 18.1 Historical Trajectories of Eurasia and the Americas
This table gives approximate dates of widespread adoption of significant developments
in three Eurasian and four Native American areas. Dates for animal domestication neglect
dogs, which were domesticated earlier than food-producing animals in both Eurasia and
ture surely did not provide the basis for most human calorie intake and
sedentary existence in American homelands until much later than in Eur
asian homelands.
As we saw in Chapters 5 and 10, only a few relatively small areas of
each hemisphere acted as a "homeland" where food production first arose
and from which it then spread. Those homelands were the Fertile Crescent
and China in Eurasia, and the Andes and Amazonia, Mesoamerica, and
the eastern United States in the Americas. The rate of spread of key devel
opments is especially well understood for Europe, thanks to the many
archaeologists at work there. As Table 18.1 summarizes for England, once
food production and village living had arrived from the Fertile Crescent
after a long lag (5,000 years), the subsequent lag for England's adoption
of chiefdoms, states, writing, and especially metal tools was much shorter:
2,000 years for the first widespread metal tools of copper and bronze, and
only 250 years for widespread iron tools. Evidently, it was much easier for
one society of already sedentary farmers to "borrow" metallurgy from
