alphabet had to travel from its homeland on the eastern shores of the Med
iterranean to reach Ireland, Ethiopia, and Southeast Asia within 2,000
years of its invention. But humans are slowed by ecological and water
barriers that crows can fly over. The states of North Africa (with writing)
and West Africa (without writing) were separated from each other by
Saharan desert unsuitable for agriculture and cities. The deserts of north
ern Mexico similarly separated the urban centers of southern Mexico from
the chiefdoms of the Mississippi Valley. Communication between southern
Mexico and the Andes required either a sea voyage or else a long chain of
overland contacts via the narrow, forested, never urbanized Isthmus of
Darien. Hence the Andes, West Africa, and the Mississippi Valley were
effectively rather isolated from societies with writing.
That's not to say that those societies without writing were totally iso
lated. West Africa eventually did receive Fertile Crescent domestic animals
across the Sahara, and later accepted Islamic influence, including Arabic
writing. Corn diffused from Mexico to the Andes and, more slowly, from
Mexico to the Mississippi Valley. But we already saw in Chapter 10 that
the north-south axes and ecological barriers within Africa and the Ameri
cas retarded the diffusion of crops and domestic animals. The history of
writing illustrates strikingly the similar ways in which geography and ecol
ogy influenced the spread of human inventions.
