compare the shapes and orientations of the continents. You'll be
struck by an obvious difference. The Americas span a much greater dis
tance north-south (9,000 miles) than east-west: only 3,000 miles at the
widest, narrowing to a mere 40 miles at the Isthmus of Panama. That is,
the major axis of the Americas is north-south. The same is also true,
though to a less extreme degree, for Africa. In contrast, the major axis of
Eurasia is east-west. What effect, if any, did those differences in the orien
tation of the continents' axes have on human history?
This chapter will be about what I see as their enormous, sometimes
tragic, consequences. Axis orientations affected the rate of spread of crops
and livestock, and possibly also of writing, wheels, and other inventions.
That basic feature of geography thereby contributed heavily to the very
different experiences of Native Americans, Africans, and Eurasians in the
last 500 years.
FOOD PRODUCTION'S SPREAD proves as crucial to understanding
geographic differences in the rise of guns, germs, and steel as did its ori
gins, which we considered in the preceding chapters. That's because, as we
