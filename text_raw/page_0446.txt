Chapter 14
The fourfold classification of human societies into bands, tribes, chief
doms, and states owes much to two books by Elman Service: Primitive
Social Organization (New York: Random House, 1962) and Origins of
the State and Civilization (New York: Norton, 1975). A related classifica
tion of societies, using different terminology, is Morton Fried, The Evolu
tion of Political Society (New York: Random House, 1967). Three
important review articles on the evolution of states and societies are Kent
Flannery, "The cultural evolution of civilizations," Annual Review of
Ecology and Systematics 3:399-426 (1972), the same author's "Prehis
toric social evolution," pp. 1-26 in Carol and Melvin Ember, eds.,
Research Frontiers in Anthropology (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall,
1995), and Henry Wright, "Recent research on the origin of the state,"
Annual Review of Anthropology 6:379-97 (1977). Robert Carneiro, "A
theory of the origin of the state," Science 169:733-38 (1970), argues that
states arise through warfare under conditions in which land is ecologically
limiting. Karl Wittfogel, Oriental Despotism (New Haven: Yale University
Press, 1957), relates state origins to large-scale irrigation and hydraulic
management. Three essays in On the Evolution of Complex Societies, by
William Sanders, Henry Wright, and Robert Adams (Malibu: Undena,
1984), present differing views of state origins, while Robert Adams, The
Evolution of Urban Society (Chicago: Aldine, 1966), contrasts state ori
gins in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica.
Among studies of the evolution of societies in specific parts of the
world, sources for Mesopotamia include Robert Adams, Heartland of
Cities (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), and J. N. Postgate,
Early Mesopotamia (London: Routledge, 1992); for Mesoamerica, Rich
ard Blanton et al., Ancient Mesoamerica (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer
sity Press, 1981), and Joyce Marcus and Kent Flannery, Zapotec
Civilization (London: Thames and Hudson, 1996); for the Andes, Richard
