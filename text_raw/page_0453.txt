other than Eskimo-Aleut and Na-Dene languages into the Amerind family,

Stanford University Press, 1987), and Merritt Ruhlen, A Guide to the
World's Languages, vol. 1 (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987).
Standard accounts of the origin and spread of the wheel for transport

Press, 1986), and Christopher Morris and D. James Rackham, eds., Norse

(New York: Oxford University Press, 1971) and The European Discovery
of America: The Southern Voyages, A.D. 1492-1616 (New York: Oxford
