Figure 17.2. The paths of the Austronesian expansion, with approxi
mate dates when each region was reached. 4a = Borneo, 4b = Celebes,
4c = Timor (around 2500 B.C.). 5a = Halmahera (around 1600 B.C.).
5b = Java, 5c = Sumatra (around 2000 B.C.). 6a = Bismarck Archipel
ago (around 1600 B.C.). 6b = Malay Peninsula, 6c - Vietnam (around
1000 B.C.). 7 = Solomon Archipelago (around 1600 B.C.). 8 = Santa
Cruz, 9c = Tonga, 9d = New Caledonia (around 1200 B.C.). 10b =
Society Islands, 10c = Cook Islands, 11a = Tuamotu Archipelago
(around A.D. 1).
At least until the expansion reached coastal New Guinea, travel
between islands was probably by double-outrigger sailing canoes, which
are still widespread throughout Indonesia today. That boat design repre
sented a major advance over the simple dugout canoes prevalent among
traditional peoples living on inland waterways throughout the world. A
dugout canoe is just what its name implies: a solid tree trunk "dug out"
(that is, hollowed out), and its ends shaped, by an adze. Since the canoe is
as round-bottomed as the trunk from which it was carved, the least imbal
ance in weight distribution tips the canoe toward the overweighted side.
