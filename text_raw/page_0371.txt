Alaska established itself across the strait on the opposite Siberian coast.
The first documented Eurasian attempt to colonize the Americas was by
the Norse at Arctic and sub-Arctic latitudes (Figure 18.1). Norse from
Norway colonized Iceland in A.D. 874, then Norse from Iceland colonized
Greenland in A.D. 986, and finally Norse from Greenland repeatedly vis
ited the northeastern coast of North America between about A.D. 1000
and 1350. The sole Norse archaeological site discovered in the Americas
is on Newfoundland, possibly the region described as Vinland in Norse
sagas, but these also mention landings evidently farther north, on the
coasts of Labrador and Baffin Island.
Iceland's climate permitted herding and extremely limited agriculture,
and its area was sufficient to support a Norse-derived population that has
persisted to this day. But most of Greenland is covered by an ice cap, and
even the two most favorable coastal fjords were marginal for Norse food
production. The Greenland Norse population never exceeded a few thou
sand. It remained dependent on imports of food and iron from Norway,
and of timber from the Labrador coast. Unlike Easter Island and other
