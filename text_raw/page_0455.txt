For information about Madagascar, two starting points are Robert
Dewar and Henry Wright, "The culture history of Madagascar," Journal
of World Prehistory 7:417-66 (1993), and Pierre Verin, The History of
Civilization in North Madagascar (Rotterdam: Balkema, 1986). A detailed
study of the linguistic evidence about the source for the colonization of
Madagascar is Otto Dahl, Migration from Kalimantan to Madagascar
(Oslo: Norwegian University Press, 1991). Possible musical evidence for
Indonesian contact with East Africa is described by A. M. Jones, Africa
and Indonesia: The Evidence of the Xylophone and Other Musical and
Cultural Factors (Leiden: Brill, 1971). Important evidence about the early
settlement of Madagascar comes from dated bones of now extinct animals
as summarized by Robert Dewar, "Extinctions in Madagascar: The loss of
the subfossil fauna," pp. 574-93 in Paul Martin and Richard Klein, eds.,
Quaternary Extinctions (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1984). A
tantalizing subsequent fossil discovery is reported by R. D. E. MacPhee
and David Burney, "Dating of modified femora of extinct dwarf Hippo
potamus from Southern Madagascar," Journal of Archaeological Science
18:695-706 (1991). The onset of human colonization is assessed from
paleobotanical evidence by David Burney, "Late Holocene vegetational
change in Central Madagascar," Quaternary Research 28:130-43 (1987).
