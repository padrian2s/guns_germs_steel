crescent-like shape of its uplands on a map: see Figure 8.1). That area
appears to have been the earliest site for a whole string of developments,
including cities, writing, empires, and what we term (for better or worse)
civilization. All those developments sprang, in turn, from the dense human
populations, stored food surpluses, and feeding of nonfarming specialists
made possible by the rise of food production in the form of crop cultiva
tion and animal husbandry. Food production was the first of those major
innovations to appear in the Fertile Crescent. Hence any attempt to under
stand the origins of the modern world must come to grips with the ques
tion why the Fertile Crescent's domesticated plants and animals gave it
such a potent head start.
Fortunately, the Fertile Crescent is by far the most intensively studied
and best understood part of the globe as regards the rise of agriculture.
For most crops domesticated in or near the Fertile Crescent, the wild plant
ancestor has been identified; its close relationship to the crop has been
proven by genetic and chromosomal studies; its wild geographic range is
known; its changes under domestication have been identified and are often
understood at the level of single genes; those changes can be observed in
