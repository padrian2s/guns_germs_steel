Genetic evidence of human origins is the subject of the two books by L.
Luca Cavalli-Sforza et al. already cited under the Prologue, and of chapter
1 of my book The Third Chimpanzee. Two technical papers with recent
advances in the genetic evidence are J. L. Mountain and L. L. Cavalli-
Sforza, "Inference of human evolution through cladistic analysis of
nuclear DNA restriction polymorphism," Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences 91:6515-19 (1994), and D. B. Goldstein et al.,
"Genetic absolute dating based on microsatellites and the origin of mod
ern humans," ibid. 92:6723-27 (1995).
References to the human colonization of Australia, New Guinea, and
the Bismarck and Solomon Archipelagoes, and to extinctions of large ani
mals there, are listed under further readings for Chapter 15. In particular,
Tim Flannery, The Future Eaters (New York: Braziller, 1995), discusses
those subjects in clear, understandable terms and explains the problems
with claims of very recent survival of extinct big Australian mammals.
The standard text on Late Pleistocene and Recent extinctions of large
animals is Paul Martin and Richard Klein, eds., Quaternary Extinctions
(Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1984). More recent updates are
Richard Klein, "The impact of early people on the environment: The case
of large mammal extinctions," pp. 13-34 in J. E. Jacobsen and J. Firor,
Human Impact on the Environment (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press,
1992), and Anthony Stuart, "Mammalian extinctions in the Late Pleisto
cene of Northern Eurasia and North America," Biological Reviews
66:453-62 (1991). David Steadman summarizes recent evidence that
extinction waves accompanied human settlement of Pacific islands in his
paper "Prehistoric extinctions of Pacific island birds: Biodiversity meets
zooarchaeology," Science 267:1123-31 (1995).
Popular accounts of the settlement of the Americas, the accompanying
extinctions of large mammals, and the resulting controversies are Brian
Fagan, The Great Journey: The Peopling of Ancient America (New York:
Thames and Hudson, 1987), and chapter 18 of my book The Third Chim
panzee, both of which provide many other references. Ronald Carlisle, ed.,
Americans before Columbus: Ice-Age Origins (Pittsburgh: University of
Pittsburgh, 1988), includes a chapter by J. M. Adovasio and his colleagues
on pre-Clovis evidence at the Meadowcroft site. Papers by C. Vance
