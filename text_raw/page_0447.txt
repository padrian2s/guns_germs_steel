moluminescence dating of a 50,000-year-old human occupation site in
^ northern Australia," Nature 345:153-56 (1990), and Jim Allen and Simon
Holdaway, "The contamination of Pleistocene radiocarbon determina
tions in Australia," Antiquity 69:101-12 (1995). Robert Attenborough
and Michael Alpers, eds., Human Biology in Papua New Guinea (Oxford:
Clarendon Press, 1992), summarizes New Guinea archaeology as well as
languages and genetics.
As for the prehistory of Northern Melanesia (the Bismarck and Solo
mon Archipelagoes, northeast and east of New Guinea), discussion will be
found in the above-cited books by Thorne and Raymond, Flannery, and
Allen et al. Papers pushing back the dates for the earliest occupation of
Northern Melanesia include Stephen Wickler and Matthew Spriggs,
