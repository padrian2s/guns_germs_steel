of tropical Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. However, indigenous
germs and food producers prevented Europeans from settling most of this
region in significant numbers. Within this area, only New Zealand, New
Caledonia, and Hawaii—the largest and most remote islands, lying far
thest from the equator and hence in the most nearly temperate (Europe
like) climates—now support large European populations. Thus, unlike
Australia and the Americas, East Asia and most Pacific islands remain
occupied by East Asian and Pacific peoples.
